Dr. Sun is a professional counselor, and Xiao Jun is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Jun shared the following concern:

Client: The confusion after senior year, the fear before the college entrance exam, can you give me some advice? Right now, I feel like I've been unnecessary since the day I was born, like I shouldn't be in this world. As a senior student, I feel negated by my family, school, friends, and teachers. I truly feel so sad, like everything doesn't need me, and to them, I am dispensable. Right now, my mind is only on the college entrance exam, but my poor academic performance often leads to doubt. I'm genuinely exhausted every day, with no friends, so I'm alone. I can do without these things, but I'm seriously confused right now. I want to take the exam, I want to get into university, but I don't know where to start. No matter how hard I try, there's no progress, and maybe you'll say my study methods are problematic, but no one has ever told me how to correct them. I'm really tired, and I feel like my life is meaningless now. I don't know how to face the college entrance exam. I always believe that if I try hard, I'll get into university, but every exam only brings me hit after hit. I don't know how to study effectively anymore, I'm confused. Now I can't even do well in my best subjects, English and Physics, let alone the others. Thank you for reading. I really want to take the exam well; I don't want to let them down. Can you give me some advice? Thank you.

Dr. Sun: Hug~ I can sense your anxiety from your question. This state is quite common under the high pressure of high school. What I want to say is, I can see your determination, and that's something many people don't have! For the college entrance exam, the most important thing isn't knowledge, it's mentality. It's the mentality of being sure to win! All that talk about relaxing and taking it easy is easy to say, but I'm not the one being guaranteed admission, so why should I relax?! I have my goals, how could I possibly give up! Having a goal makes it manageable, then you just need a plan! A plan for reasonable allocation of review time. What? You don't know how to make one? Start with a sea-of-problems tactic from the first year. Just keep practicing, surely you can do that! Self-doubt is just a waste of time. Dedicate your time to practice, review questions when you can. For English, listen and recite more; for math, physics, and chemistry, focus on classic problems, and revisit each type repetitively. If you don't understand something, ask! Let go of your pride and boldly ask your teachers. That's what they're there for, to answer your questions and clarify doubts! This isn't the time to wait until graduation for a catch-up session! When you can't figure something out yourself, go ask without any psychological burden, just make sure you understand the problem. Don't worry about others' expectations, think about your own potential. Just focus on studying hard, check out videos from Hebei Hengshui High School, everyone there is fighting passionately like you! Have confidence!

Dr. Wu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Na is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Na shared the following concern:

Client: I've noticed a pattern where I tend to constantly self-reflect and criticize myself. When I talk to my mom, it falls into this really unpleasant pattern. Whenever I share my troubles, she remains indifferent, but as soon as I start criticizing myself, she looks pleased. I feel like I'm at a loss; I realize that whenever I meet people, I end up self-criticizing, thinking I'm lacking here or there, and then insincerely complimenting others. This has become a pattern for me, but I know it's not normal and it's troubling me.

Dr. Wu: Hello, I feel quite distressed seeing you habitually check and criticize yourself. I noticed this pattern appears in conversations with your mom, and you've used the word "disgusting," which suggests you strongly dislike this pattern. When you're sharing your troubles, your mom seems indifferent. I guess at that moment you need your mom's comfort, but she chooses not to respond, and this lack of response makes you feel "I shouldn't share my troubles." Conversely, when you're self-critical, your mom provides positive feedback. You feel this pattern is unhealthy; habitually self-examining in conversations with others and then giving fake compliments isn't common in interpersonal interactions. I'm glad you have the awareness to realize you don't like this pattern and hope to change it for more comfort in your life. Perhaps this pattern was learned from interactions with your mom as a child, so it's become ingrained over time. We need to be patient with ourselves, allowing slow change. First, you can explore your feelings about this pattern—is it dependency, habit, familiarity, or something else? Is this feeling something you really need, or could you live without it? Then think about other ways to interact, observe others' behavioral patterns, and incorporate them into your repertoire. Choose a pattern you like and start experimenting with it, consciously recognizing moments before you start "self-examining" and aim to replace it with your preferred pattern. Allow yourself to change slowly; if you revert to the original pattern, know it's normal and you have the ability to find the pattern that fits you. Finally, I'll share an interesting example: self-criticism can appear as humility, which is socially encouraged, but at times this humility can block the flow of relationships and conversations. For instance, if I've re-decorated my house and people praise me, and I say, "Oh, it's nothing, I just copied stuff I saw online, and even mounted the desk crooked," this kind of dialogue tends to stagnate. If you want the relationship and conversation to flow, you could say, "Thank you for the compliments! I spent a lot of time researching online and pieced it together bit by bit. I was exhausted after the makeover, but I feel really proud." I hope you find a pattern you like and make it your habit!

Dr. Zhao is a professional counselor, and Xiao Ming is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Ming shared the following concern:

Client: Senior year, social anxiety—should I distract myself by making some friends, or just stay aloof? My social anxiety is pretty severe, and I dislike leaving my comfort zone. It feels like interacting with unfamiliar classmates takes a lot of courage. Should I focus on studying and keeping to myself, or put some effort into making friends? Not having friends is certainly less troublesome, but I do feel lonely at times.

Dr. Zhao: Hello, I see you're hesitating about making friends. In your senior year, you must have joined a completely new class; they already have their own circles, and if you want to make friends, it might take more effort to connect. Think about it: how do you define a friend? Someone to eat at the cafeteria with, to share your thoughts, or just to chat about daily life and ask about homework? Based on your definition of a friend, do you have to find them among your new classmates? If it's not necessary to find them among the current strangers, could you find friends on safe online platforms? For example, if you just need someone to talk to, you could find a trustworthy person online willing to listen. If you do need to find friends among the strangers in your class, what concerns do you have about interacting with them? If those concerns become reality, how much energy will you need to cope with them? Or, how much courage do you need to take the first step in making friends, and how much energy will that courage consume? How much time do you spend studying each day, and how much impact do friends have on your studies? Could having friends possibly be more trouble than it's worth, and what does loneliness mean to you? Once you have a clearer understanding, you can reconsider whether to make friends. The pressure in your senior year is undoubtedly high. If you feel you don't have much energy, staying in your comfort zone where you feel safe and comfortable is perfectly fine. If the courage to make friends doesn't deplete your energy but instead gives you energy, then you can bravely make new friends. Wishing you success in your college entrance exams!

Dr. Wang is a professional counselor, and Xiao Qiang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Qiang shared the following concern:

Client: I actually feel very resistant inside. How can I improve my execution? There are many things I want to do, but I keep thinking about them without taking action. How can I get myself to act? I really feel resistant, but how can I get moving?

Dr. Wang: Hello, I see that you have many things you want to do, but haven't taken action yet. You feel a strong resistance to your own inaction, yet you're unsure how to get moving. Consider whether these things lack intrinsic motivation. Are these tasks something that must be completed immediately? Are they so important that not doing them would be disastrous? What would happen if you don't do them? Can you accept the consequences? Why do you want to do them, and how do they benefit you? By clarifying the priorities and understanding your true perspective on these matters, you can better uncover your internal motivation. Simplify the list of "things you want to do" by tackling the most important ones first, or start with them. Alternatively, begin with something you feel most motivated to do, to create a momentum of action. Allow yourself to start with small tasks and set small goals. At first, taking action may be challenging, but developing "momentum" and building confidence will help. For example, if you want to read a book, aim to read just one page a day. This way, starting to read won't have much resistance because the task is simple, and you'll start reading right away. Completing the "one-page" task will build your confidence, and this confidence will grow stronger with daily reinforcement. I hope you find your motivation, start the momentum of action, and move forward when you're ready.

Dr. Xu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Lan is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Lan shared the following concern:

Client: As a new junior high school student, I often have conflicts with my mom, but I don't know what to do. As I've grown up, I tend to argue with my parents, and my mom often says my arguments lack reason, but holding it in makes me uncomfortable. My mom is worried about my academics even though I'm only in the first year, she constantly talks to me about the high school entrance exam. Recently, I've been addicted to games, secretly taking my phone to play, but I always get caught. We argue, and I might have said some not-so-nice things during these arguments. My mom says I've lost my conscience and starts to ignore me. She says, "Here's twenty bucks, you handle it yourself. Aren't you envious of others eating instant noodles? Go buy some yourself. Once you've bought it, deal with it yourself, so I don't have to go through the trouble of cooking food that you don't even appreciate." However, I have never said anything that disparages her cooking. She doesn't bother with my breakfast either: "There's stuff in the fridge, cook it yourself or don't, it doesn't matter to me if you don't grow tall or your health suffers." "If you can't get into high school, figure it out yourself. You can go work or do whatever, just don't stay at home living off me." My mom doesn't have a strong heart, yet I'm always arguing with her. She keeps saying that having me around takes years off her life, so I wonder, would it be better for her if I weren't there? Because it's really hard for me to change, if my departure could extend her life, then I can choose to leave, right?

Dr. Xu: Hello, sending you a hug~ From your description, you really don't want to affect your mom's mood, but have inadvertently stirred up conflict, which is very understandable given your complex feelings. Based on what you've shared, your communication with your mother often unintentionally becomes heated. Perhaps with your current maturity, it's difficult to comprehend the perspectives of adults, but from your portrayal of your mother's words, I believe her intentions are good, even if her way of speaking can be hard to accept. Considering you are at an age characterized by adolescent rebellion, maybe you feel that your emotions are often uncontrollable. I truly understand your sadness when being misunderstood and your desire to prove your feelings to your mother, which is completely normal. As you gradually mature, you'll start to understand things that are currently elusive. I suggest that when you clash with your mother, try to internally weigh the importance of health versus the supremacy of words. Life and health are always the top priority, and perhaps, with time, you won't be as affected.

Dr. Liu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Fang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Fang shared the following concern:

Client: The interview exam is coming up soon, and I'm feeling a bit nervous, with a bit of pressure? Ah, the final exams are also approaching, plus I have to face the teaching certification interview, so there's a bit of pressure.

Dr. Liu: Hello there! First, let me give you a big hug~ Let's take a look at your issue: facing the teaching qualification interview and final exams, feeling a bit stressed. Actually, we often encounter similar situations. There are always times when we are very busy, with life, study, and work all piling up together, making us wish we could split time in half. So what should we do?

Make a plan: You can list the subjects for your finals and the things you need to prepare for the teaching qualification interview. Then, based on this list, plan your time, breaking down your goals into what needs to be done each week and each day. This way, you won't feel so lost.

Prioritize based on time: If you have enough energy, you can tackle both simultaneously. If not, you can prioritize based on the timing of the two, preparing for the review and interview accordingly.

Relieve stress: You can choose some activities you enjoy to relieve stress, such as exercising, listening to music, or taking walks. Stress shouldn't accumulate; the more it piles up, the more oppressive it becomes. It's important to release it in time.

Maintain sufficient energy: The busier and more anxious you are, the more you need to maintain enough energy. With good energy, you'll be more efficient and achieve more with less effort. The best way to maintain energy is to get enough sleep.

These are just my personal views, and I hope they can help you. Best wishes~.

Dr. Chen is a professional counselor, and Xiao Ming is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Ming shared the following concern:

Client: I feel like if someone likes me, I will like them back. What should I do? When I sense that someone is paying attention to me (and it's real, not imagined), I start wondering if that person likes me. Then I become overly focused on them and overly concerned about them, and suddenly my mind is filled with thoughts of them! It seems like I start to like them! But I know that's not true affection. I haven't even talked to them or gotten to know them, so... I really don't have feelings for them. However, I do feel my heart racing out of nervousness (just the kind of nervousness from feeling someone is watching me), but that doesn't mean I'm in love! Overall, it's a very strange feeling. I feel like I'm the type of person who will like anyone who likes me back, and it would be the same with someone else. It's really distressing, what should I do? I'm begging for help!

Dr. Chen: Hello, I see that you're feeling a bit troubled by the idea that when others like you, you also tend to like them back. It's normal for people to have a good impression of those who like them, whether they are of the same or opposite sex. After all, being liked feels great, and when someone likes us, we naturally feel happy and want to reciprocate that affection. As social animals, mutual liking can aid our survival, and we are inclined towards reciprocity. According to Baidu Encyclopedia, the principle of reciprocity suggests that we should try to repay others in kind for what they have done for us. In summary, a behavior should be reciprocated with a similar behavior. So when someone likes us, we naturally want to return that liking. Love is exclusive, and you clearly understand that this isn't the kind of liking associated with love, so it's just a matter of clarifying that point. It's just that in terms of feelings and behavior, you might overly focus on and care about this person, and suddenly your mind is filled with thoughts of them, making it seem like you like them. You've mentioned that this kind of liking would happen with someone else too. You can try allowing yourself to think about the person; there's nothing wrong with that. If being overly concerned about them affects your studies, work, or life, you can write down your feelings about them to sort out your emotions. Writing it down can give you a clearer understanding of your feelings, and maybe once you've sorted it out, you won't care as much. I hope the above sharing is helpful~.

Dr. Zhao is a professional counselor, and Xiao Hong is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Hong shared the following concern:

Client: I was sexually assaulted at the age of 5. I want to get better. Can I analyze and correct my thoughts? At 5, I was lured into an abandoned house under the pretense of playing hide and seek. Then they held me down, tore off my clothes, slapped me, and forced me to nod. What happened was so dirty. I endured to the extreme, unable to continue, and in a frenzy, I rushed out regardless of the consequences. They were five and nine years old, yet I really broke free and ran out. Once outside, I realized that my ability to escape meant this could have been avoided, and I had compromised at that time. The fact had already happened, so what was the point of escaping later? It would have been better to continue being violated until it ended, staying in the darkness without pain; stepping from darkness into light is what hurts. I shouldn't have entered the house, nor should I have rushed out at the wrong time; both before and after were my mistakes. A month later, I mustered the courage to confront him, "You should apologize to me!" He said, "Even if I held you down, didn't you nod? Wasn't it your own willingness? You brought it on yourself, what does it have to do with me?" I couldn't refute a word he said. Yes, although he held me down, I didn't refuse, I nodded, it was me who nodded. Even though I was hurt, I was an accomplice with him, together we hurt myself. I was knowingly consenting, so what right do I have to demand an apology from him?

Dr. Zhao: Hello, dear poster. I really want to give you a hug first. Seeing you slowly open up is truly something that requires a lot of courage. After reading your question, I can feel your guilt and self-blame. You blame yourself for not making the "right" choice at the time, for missing the chance to save yourself. My dear, what I want to say is, you were only five years old then. At that time, you didn't know what it meant for you, only that the other person violated you, and you felt immense shame. You shouldn't have had to endure this. You were far less powerful compared to a nine-year-old boy. Before you ran away, the other person used physical violence to threaten you, and you were forced to nod in agreement. When you ran out, you felt despair because you thought what had happened was irreversible. The reason you went back was that you felt too ashamed to face the light, and returning to the darkness made you less afraid. This was a child's desperate choice. In my view, you didn't make the "wrong" choice; in fact, you were always protecting yourself. The other person used physical violence against you, and you nodded to protect yourself; when you ran out, you found that walking from darkness into light was more painful than staying in the darkness, so you returned to the darkness. These were the best choices you could make for yourself at the time. When you confronted the person a month later, they hurt you again by saying you nodded in agreement and didn't refuse. They used their "smarter" logic to refute you, leaving you speechless. But you need to see that the truth is you didn't genuinely agree to it; you were under violent threat and had to nod to protect yourself from greater harm. In your reply to me, you mentioned another child involved, who was in the same class as you in second grade and bragged about it, leading to the whole class ostracizing and verbally abusing you. My heart aches for the harm you suffered. As I listen to your story and respond to your question, I can almost feel that deep despair. So what could you have done at that time, facing a force stronger than yourself? There was nothing you could do. Your anger had nowhere to go, so it turned inward. Perhaps all these years, you've been extremely self-loathing. Our greatest pain is the inability to accept the truth. We wish to change the unchangeable, hoping the past could be different. However, I believe that the choices a person makes at any moment in their life are the best choices. I believe that a person's life inherently has this power. The younger you was hurt, that terrified, helpless child has been hiding in a corner of your heart for many years. Now we need to nurture her with more love, accompany her, and let her come out of that corner. I remember a quote from American author Tara Westover: "Who writes history? I think it's me." We are the ones who create history and also the ones who write it. We ourselves are our history. The past has become past history, but our lives are not over; we have the ability to write new history, don't we? The child from the past hesitated when moving from darkness to light, unable to bear the pain of stepping into the light. But today, I see you coming out of the darkness, exposing your wounds to the sunlight. Thank you for your courage, thank you for your honesty. From you, I feel the power of life, and this power moves me. Today, I wrote this sentence in my article and share it with you: "What is pain? If you can accept this pain, it is a gift, a gift from life." This is my answer, and I hope it helps you. Bless you.

Dr. Chen is a professional counselor, and Xiao Mei is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Mei shared the following concern:

Client: I'm worried about being sick, but I don't want to go to the hospital. What should I do? My body has some issues, but every time I think about going to the hospital, I really don't want to. Some illnesses get worse the longer you wait, and there are so many tests at the hospital that I find it hard to cope. What should I do?

Dr. Chen: Hello! First, a big hug for you. I completely understand your feelings because I share the same concerns. Actually, we all have fears of the unknown, which makes us reluctant to face them. There are many things in life we should do but don't, and worrying about potential health issues without getting checked is just one of them. This reluctance combined with worry leads to anxiety. To address this, consider the following approach. First, we are not doctors and cannot determine if there's a problem ourselves, so why not leave it to the professionals? If you're worried, go to the hospital and let the experts use their tools to conduct a thorough examination and understand your health status. Knowing the results, whether good or bad, is better than daily anxiety. Even if there is an issue, trust that professionals have ways to resolve it, and try not to overthink. Secondly, if you really don't want to go for a check-up, then live happily every day without worry or anxiety; a joyful mindset is also a good remedy. Maybe there's really nothing wrong. In any case, whatever method you choose, you need to take action rather than just worry and feel anxious, as this is beneficial for your health. I hope this helps alleviate your anxiety a bit!

Dr. Zhang is a professional counselor, and Xiao Mei is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Mei shared the following concern:

Client: Her personality is just too slow, should I continue maintaining this friendship? I only have one close friend in college, but her personality is really too slow, she's indecisive, speaks slowly, has a soft and weak temperament, lacks opinions, and has no patience. Recently, we've had a lot of conflicts because I feel she never does anything well and often complains. Every time I hear her voice, it's slow and filled with negativity, which gives me a headache. However, if I leave her, I'll be alone. I can hang out with my roommates, but everyone has their own fixed group of friends. We can hang out together, but I can't really fit in. I'm so conflicted. Lately, every second with her feels painful. This morning during Chinese class, she spent both periods playing on her phone and didn't talk to me. I really hate her to the extreme, but I also feel I shouldn't hate her so much. After all, once a person's character is formed, it's hard to change. Maybe it's because I'm trying to change her that I'm feeling so anxious and miserable. I have a personal history of depression, so now I long to be positive and full of energy. But I feel that being with her deepens my depression. These days, I've been so depressed that I don't even want to attend classes. I'm begging you, teacher, to guide me. Today, I've been constantly thinking about suicide, feeling panicked and uncomfortable, and even trembling while walking.

Dr. Zhang: Hello, sending you a hug~ After reading your description, it seems you've encountered a disagreement in your friendship. Given your history with depression, I can truly understand your current vulnerable state. From what you've described, you're having difficulty accepting your friend's personality as it lacks positivity. Indeed, most people believe that the essence of friendship lies in sharing and companionship, and these positive elements drive us to make friends. Personally, I think that aside from friendships connected through common interests and goals, most friendships are actually quite fragile. This is because most people are inherently self-centered, which is a normal phenomenon. Therefore, I suggest you meet more friends who share your interests. If you feel that more positive people can meet your needs, perhaps you shouldn't force yourself to remain in a relationship that doesn't satisfy you, whether it's friendship, love, or even family.

Dr. Zhang is a professional counselor, and Xiao Na is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Na shared the following concern:

Client: My boyfriend is really nice, but he's not ambitious and just goes with the flow. He doesn't have much drive, just muddling through life, going back and forth between work and home.

Dr. Zhang: Hello! I can feel your anxiety, sending you a hug! I see my heart, and the way you see your boyfriend reflects your own perspective. You don't accept his reality because you're dissatisfied with yourself. But there's really no need for that. Everyone's existence is unique, everyone's growth path is different, and everyone's inner desires vary greatly. So we shouldn't demand uniformity. Besides, success has different definitions. What is ambition, and what is lack of ambition? It relates to his own needs. A simple life may also be a way of living; achieving fame and fortune isn't necessarily the standard for success. Not necessarily! Inner peace, harmony with those around you, and harmony with the world are pursuits of many so-called successful people. If your boyfriend goes with the flow, works and lives diligently, and maintains inner peace, it shows a deep understanding of life, which is a great blessing. Worldly fame and fortune aren't everyone's dreams. Living a bit more relaxed and joyful can reduce many worries and conflicts, which is also an ideal state. Accepting yourself and others, and loving, is the highest state of life because love is the highest energy in the universe. I hope you find happiness and well-being!

Dr. Liu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Fang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Fang shared the following concern:

Client: There is a feeling of discomfort that accompanies me, particularly annoying. Today, I'm feeling a bit down. My mom came back from outside, busy with chores, and hearing those sounds makes me feel extremely uncomfortable, inexplicably irritated! It reminds me of my childhood when my parents were away, and I stayed with my grandma and aunt. Every time my aunt or grandpa bought me shoes that I didn't like, I would rub them hard on the ground, even though I felt very uncomfortable inside! I never expressed it! Whenever I was unhappy, my aunt and grandma would try to help me solve my problems, but I still wasn't happy, extremely annoyed. Once, I really wanted to ride my bike and ride into a big well. This feeling often accompanies me, especially during adolescence! There was also a period when I was in the second year of middle school, I felt empty inside, without support, extremely uncomfortable, unhappy all day, just wanting to cry, without knowing why. Now I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, with emotional and cognitive issues, and I feel it's related to that time. My grandma and aunt were actually good to me, never hitting or scolding me. Can any teacher help me understand this? Thank you.

Dr. Liu: Hello, questioner. After reading your inquiry, I sense that you weren't very happy during your childhood. Although your aunt and grandmother treated you well, you still couldn't feel joy. From a young age, you exhibited a trait of "repressed emotions." When your aunt and grandmother bought you shoes you didn't like, you wouldn't express it, choosing instead to "scrape your shoes hard on the ground" as a way to show your feelings. But you also felt a persistent sense of "annoyance," which is a form of anger. Anger is actually a secondary emotion, with primary emotions underlying it. When these primary emotions aren't recognized, anger emerges. You mentioned that when your mother returned home and was busy, you felt very uncomfortable and inexplicably irritated, which led you to think about your childhood. This is quite significant, as one event naturally reminded you of another, suggesting a connection between the two. In psychoanalysis, this is akin to free association. Based on your description, it seems you might have emotions towards your parents. You mentioned living with your grandmother and aunt while your parents worked away. I wonder if you missed them deeply and longed for their presence? Yet, you understood they needed to work and couldn't care for you, so you couldn't ask for it. However, this feeling persisted, and you couldn't express your emotional needs to your parents, leading to their repression. Sometimes, you might have felt lonely and helpless, with these feelings being suppressed for a long time, often manifesting as "irritability." Perhaps you couldn't express your true feelings to your aunt and grandmother because you felt they weren't the closest to you; the ones you truly wanted to be close to were your parents. Children can only truly be themselves with their parents. Here are some suggestions for you to consider: 

1. Try to express your feelings to your parents. The days when they weren't around weren't truly happy for you. You were "well-behaved" and tried not to trouble your aunt and grandmother, but the irritability never went away. You can tell your parents that you really missed them during that time and wished they could be with you. You hope to receive their love and companionship. You can even tell them that you harbor some resentment towards them, that your loneliness and helplessness were things you faced alone, and how much you wished for their support and help.

2. Reduce self-criticism. It seems you are somewhat dissatisfied with your state, sometimes wondering why you still feel annoyed despite your aunt and grandmother being so good to you. You might even criticize yourself for it. Recognize that as a child, many of your needs weren't met, and your unexpressed aggression turned inward. In middle school, you often felt like crying, felt empty inside, and once even considered riding your bike into a well. This sounds like symptoms of depression, where the aggression is directed at oneself. Accept your current true state and recognize the unmet needs within. Fortunately, you can express these feelings to your parents, allowing them to see your inner emotions, which is the greatest healing. 

This is my response, and I hope it helps you. Best wishes.

Dr. Sun is a professional counselor, and Xiao Fang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Fang shared the following concern:

Client: Having a soft heart often leads to being taken advantage of and falling for deceit; feeling embarrassed to say no—how can this change? Whenever I encounter a situation, my heart is always too soft, feeling sorry for others, always thinking on behalf of others, unable to say no, feeling embarrassed to refuse—how can I change this?

Dr. Sun: Hello, OP. You're a very kind person, always too soft-hearted when encountering issues, thinking of others and feeling embarrassed to refuse. However, in our lives, there are times when we must establish boundaries for ourselves and others; otherwise, people won't know what we care about. This means we need to practice expressing negative emotions. You need to be able to say "no" to others without feeling ashamed. Sometimes, put what you value most first and strive for the compensation you deserve for your efforts. This will help you suffer less and avoid harm. So, how do you appropriately express such emotions? You can use the XYZ method—when you do Y in situation X, I feel Z. Here are some examples: "I strongly feel I should receive more recognition while contributing so much to the company," "I felt hurt yesterday when you made fun of me during dinner." You can practice saying "no," try refusing others. When you actually do it, you'll find it's not very difficult. Best wishes~.

Dr. Zhao is a professional counselor, and Xiao Na is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Na shared the following concern:

Client: Seeing someone I like being bullied in class makes me feel so upset. What should I do? There's this boy I really like, and he's always so, so gentle with me. I really like him, but in class, he seems like the silly type who always gets picked on. Many people don’t like him, and a lot of people ignore him. It seems like nobody really wants to talk to him when he speaks to others. I feel so upset about this. Just thinking about him now makes me feel really sad. What should I do?

Dr. Zhao: Hello, it's clear that you are a kind-hearted and good girl who feels upset about the unfair treatment he receives. From your description, it's evident that he is very important to you, and you care about him and worry for him. Your description reminds me of Eileen Chang's novel "Jasmine Tea." The boy you described resembles the male protagonist in the story, and the female lead is a wonderful girl like you, kind-hearted and drawn to a male lead who seems unappreciated. However, the female lead in the story likes him without realizing it, while the male lead envies the father the female lead has. In the end, when the male lead proposes a relationship, the female lead says she's willing to consider him as a man rather than just a friend. The male lead, unsatisfied with her response, ends up hitting her, and the novel abruptly ends there. Here are some suggestions regarding your question on what to do, which I hope will be helpful. It's okay if you don't find these suggestions appropriate; you can either accept or disregard them. Since you feel distressed for him, you might try talking to him to see what he thinks about these matters. Alternatively, you could subtly ask your best friends or close classmates if they know what might be going on. If you have reservations, you can initially not mention it’s about him and instead frame it as a story or news item, then say something like, “Someone in our class seems to be in a similar situation, do you know why?”

Dr. Liu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Ming is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Ming shared the following concern:

Client: My mother has a mental illness that affects my life. What should I do? My mother has always had a mental illness and has consistently refused to take her medication. Recently, she's had another episode. Last week, while I was out with friends, she suddenly called me at night saying a colleague had come to look for me (which wasn't true). It really made me believe my colleague had come. Today, she suddenly showed up downstairs at my workplace to bring me food. She's not living with us right now because she's afraid of being taken to a mental hospital. I'm very worried she might talk nonsense to my colleagues or that my colleagues will find out about her illness. At the core of it, I'm scared that my colleagues will look down on me or ignore me if they find out. What should I do?

Dr. Liu: Hello, here's a hug for you~ From your description, I understand how troubled you feel because your mother's uncontrollable behavior, due to her reluctance to cooperate with treatment, is affecting your normal life. Based on your description, first, you're unsure how to persuade your mother to actively seek treatment, which is something that requires a professional doctor to handle. I suggest taking her to a reputable hospital for treatment. Generally speaking, psychotherapists cannot treat psychiatric patients.

Secondly, I've summarized some of the actions your mother has taken, and both incidents seem to be related to you. Perhaps you should realize your mother's current vulnerability and that she needs your companionship. If possible, try to spend more time with her during this treatment period.

Finally, regarding your mindset, it is understandable that you don't want to face the strange looks from friends around you. However, it is indeed true that our society holds many prejudices against psychiatric patients and often neglects issues like mental illness. Perhaps only when our societal awareness develops enough will people let go of these biases.

Dr. Liu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Yu is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Yu shared the following concern:

Client: What is the psychological mechanism behind frequently going to the bathroom? Some children like to sit on the toilet for half an hour, and this happens every day, mainly to play on their phones. Has anyone else noticed similar situations?

Dr. Liu: Hugs to you! I'm not sure how old the child you're referring to is, so I'll respond based on the age I imagine. I guess he is probably around 12-16 years old (this age range is during adolescence). Let's explore the reasons why the child likes staying in the bathroom. Is it because he genuinely feels the need to use it, or because the bathroom provides him a private space where he feels comfortable and less anxious? If it's the first reason, then take the child for a medical check-up to see if there's any organic issue. If it's the second reason, consider that in real life, the child is in adolescence, a stage where they start paying more attention to their own feelings, becoming more sensitive, and experiencing significant mood swings. On one hand, they seek independence, feeling they've grown up, and on the other hand, they can't completely leave their parents and still need their essential support. This may lead to internal conflicts, and when problems arise, they might be reluctant to communicate honestly with their parents, turning to the virtual world for help or comfort (you mentioned he plays on his phone in the bathroom, and I boldly speculate that this is the motivation). Additionally, consider the external environment he is in: is his current living environment tense and high-pressure? If so, children are sensitive to this atmosphere and might want to escape. So, in reality, he found the bathroom as a place, and ideally, he found the online space (on his phone), which he feels is more comfortable. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; everyone needs to relax a bit, right? After a rough analysis, what can we do? Could you discuss with the child how he feels playing on his phone in the bathroom? If he opens up and shares his feelings with you, wouldn't that give you a chance to dispel your doubts? You can try! Hope this helps! Best wishes!

Dr. Chen is a professional counselor, and Xiao Hong is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Hong shared the following concern:

Client: I'm a 29-year-old woman who feels foolish and constantly doubts myself—what should I do? I often doubt myself and feel like I'm useless, foolish, unable to learn anything or do anything well. I'm afraid of failure, and it's very upsetting. How can I adjust this mindset and believe in myself?

Dr. Chen: Feeling like you're foolish must stem from being in an environment that has long hypnotized you into believing it. When you start to believe this yourself, all your actions may seek to prove it: "Yes, I am foolish; I can't do anything." Because you believe you're foolish, you can't gain confidence, and without confidence, it's easier to fear facing failure. At 29, I suggest seeking professional help to work together to identify your innate and acquired strengths based on your current situation, and help you see that you can succeed, which will then lead to sustained self-belief. This might be a faster way to understand yourself. In truth, each of us comes into this world fully equipped with talents, though there are differences between us. No one is completely worthless. So, if you want to change your current situation, start by trying to identify your strengths and advantages. If you can't do this alone, ask those around you for help. If someone starts to criticize while helping you discover these, try saying: "Stop! I need to know my strengths and advantages! Thank you!" Want to give it a try first?

Dr. Zhou is a professional counselor, and Xiao Jun is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Jun shared the following concern:

Client: Is showing your emotions openly a disadvantage? Should we control our true feelings? If people around us keep saying, "Showing your emotions too openly will lead to losses," how should we change? Should we consciously control ourselves, or just let it be?

Dr. Zhou: Hugs to the questioner. It’s true that some people do consider whether or not to show their emotions. Let's first sort out the issue [Issue Sorting]. The main concern of the questioner is the worry that being too expressive with one's emotions could lead to disadvantages based on what others have said. This worry arises from the fear of suffering losses by doing so. [Understanding and Analysis] From my perspective, expressing emotions isn't necessarily bad. Various things in life trigger different emotions, and these emotions are accompanied by expressions. Being expressive reflects a healthy mindset. In normal life, I believe you also prefer to be friends with people who show their expressions, as it spares you from guessing their thoughts, making interactions more relaxed. Moreover, suppressing our emotions excessively can lead to psychological imbalance, and over time, may cause mental health issues. Therefore, it's very important to express and release emotions appropriately. However, if we express particularly intense emotions indiscriminately, it can lead to awkward situations or dissatisfaction from others. Thus, it is essential to express emotions appropriately according to the situation and to control them. 

So how do we manage our emotions? 1. Don't overly suppress emotions. If the situation is really inappropriate, find a suitable time and place to release them later. 2. Divert your attention; especially when feeling angry or sad, shift your focus to reduce the risk of losing control. 3. Self-suggestion is an effective method of emotional management. Proper use can help us better manage our emotions. 4. Acknowledge your shortcomings in emotional management. When realizing there are deficiencies, accept them and actively seek ways to manage them. Once we can control our emotions, choosing to show emotions openly or not can be entirely up to us. These are some of my thoughts, and I hope they are helpful to you.

Dr. Zhao is a professional counselor, and Xiao Na is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Na shared the following concern:

Client: Can being obsessed with listening to music have negative effects? I feel like I can listen to music while doing anything, with the volume turned up high. Gradually, I've become unable to adapt to a quiet environment. What could be the reason for this?

Dr. Zhao: Hello, here's a warm hug for you. Indulging in something to a reasonable degree can be incredibly beneficial for our mental and physical health, especially activities like music, painting, and yoga, which cultivate our sensibilities and health. These activities help us face and understand ourselves better and are generally more popular and beneficial to us. However, it’s important to maintain balance in everything; even the best things can become detrimental if overdone. For instance, drinking too much plain water can cause water intoxication, lowering the average nutrient levels in our bloodstream, right? You mentioned that you can listen to music while doing anything, often at a high volume, and gradually you've become unable to adapt to quiet environments. What Phil thinks is: first, listening to music while doing anything, even if we think we’re not focusing on the music, this close distance or loud volume can inadvertently lead us to develop a habit of distraction. It creates a reliance where we can’t concentrate without music. Additionally, when music is played loudly, our hearing adjusts to that volume, reducing our sensitivity. In quiet environments, we might feel more uncomfortable compared to noisier settings, tending to prefer environments with some sound. Over time, not only could this harm our hearing and ears, but it can also affect the habits formed in our minds, making us unable to adapt to silence. Therefore, whether it is to avoid this negative outcome, return to a previous state, or protect your health, Phil suggests you slightly reduce the frequency and volume of music and gradually adjust back. I hope my response can help you (･ω･)ﾉ.

Dr. Zhou is a professional counselor, and Xiao Hong is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Hong shared the following concern:

Client: Feeling the pressure of studying, it's tough when you can't learn, so you end up playing games? Studying computer science doesn't seem easy no matter what; it's really hard, too difficult, extreme psychological pressure from feeling stupid and not knowing how to study, poor grades, feeling miserable from not being able to learn, so just playing games, computer networks are really tough.

Dr. Zhou: Hello, given your academic setbacks, you feel overwhelmed by the difficulty of your studies and are choosing to distract yourself through gaming to relieve stress. The troubles you face are a common occurrence during student years. Your primary issue now is the inability to complete your current academic tasks, leading to immense pressure. Let’s discuss how to effectively alleviate this stress. Does playing games actually relieve stress? It must be acknowledged that it has some effect. We often say: "Playing a little enriches one's mind, playing too much harms the body." Moderate gaming can be beneficial for mental and physical health. However, I feel that your current gaming habits are more about using games to numb yourself and temporarily escape the pressure of your studies, while the stress itself remains unresolved, simply set aside. This creates a vicious cycle: pressure > gaming > no study time > incomplete academic tasks > increased pressure > desire to game... Ultimately, the pressure only grows larger.

An effective way to alleviate current stress is to achieve a breakthrough in your studies, reignite your confidence, or consider changing majors to start anew. Choosing a major in computer networking suggests your recognition of its future prospects, and you seem relatively inclined towards it. Therefore, you need to reassess how you truly perceive your current major. Whether or not you choose to switch majors, you should be prepared to start from scratch, with the determination to begin from zero.

Let's talk about study methods. To make progress in your studies, I believe you need to change your approach. You haven’t yet found a method that suits you, leading to low study efficiency. So, identify the key reason why your study results are not apparent. Is it a memory issue, a comprehension issue, or something else? Addressing the specific problem is the way to resolve it effectively.

Regain your confidence in learning. Set a small goal for yourself, nothing too high, but within your capability. Achieving each goal will undoubtedly have a positive impact on you. Facing pressure directly is the best approach. I hope this helps you!

Dr. Zhang is a professional counselor, and Xiao Lan is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Lan shared the following concern:

Client: Male, 25 years old, no romantic or sexual attraction—is this asexuality? I'm a 25-year-old man, never been in a relationship. I feel anxious about my parents pressuring me to go on blind dates, and I don't feel any urge to date or have sexual relations.

Dr. Zhang: Hello, regarding asexuality, I believe it requires a specific process of identification and cannot be understood by simply looking at the surface phenomenon. Let's discuss it together from the following aspects to help resolve your doubts as much as possible. [Is the current lack of romantic and sexual desire a persistent state?] We know that when people enter puberty, they begin to exhibit more noticeable sexual characteristics and experience stronger sexual impulses. These impulses are often beyond conscious control, especially at night when sleeping, upon waking in the morning, feeling energized, or accidentally coming across images or videos of scantily clad women, which may lead to physiological reactions such as erections. Of course, this phenomenon varies from person to person, as the level of sexual energy and its fullness differs for everyone, and these might also be linked to genetic inheritance. Try recalling whether you've had experiences of sexual excitement after entering puberty? Or whether you've experienced natural erections upon waking in the morning or before sleeping? If you remember these occurrences, and they have been present recently, we need to consider if you're simply uninterested in dating. However, if your memory lacks these experiences, it is advisable to visit a urology clinic to undergo a physical examination to rule out any abnormal causes related to the body. When no physical cause is discovered, then we can consider factors on a psychological level. [Reflect on whether you have experienced traumatic events related to "romantic relationships and sexual impulses"?] After examining physical health, we can consider if this current situation is related to some past traumatic experiences. Such experiences may evoke emotions like fear and anxiety, which often lie deeply hidden in the subconscious and are difficult to effectively perceive, only manifesting through behaviors like rejection of romantic relationships and sexual activity. Additionally, we might consider if your current state is related to parental pressure to marry. Were you already in this state before your parents started pressuring you to marry? It is advised to seek a professional psychological counselor for consultation to explore the underlying reasons for your current state. I hope the above response is helpful to you.

Dr. Wu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Fang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Fang shared the following concern:

Client: I constantly have to consider many issues, and I feel like my existence in the world is meaningless. I feel like I've always faced difficulties in making friends. During seventh and eighth grade, I often found myself competing with others, yet I always lost. I don’t know why, but I always lowered my own status. Whenever she got upset, I would humbly beg for her forgiveness and agree with whatever she said. I always felt that if I refused her once, she would leave me. When I reached ninth grade, my parents suddenly decided to transfer me to another class, claiming it was for my studies. I often cried inexplicably during class, feeling really miserable. 

When I entered high school, I met a girl with whom I really connected, and I felt hopeful, thinking everything would change. But later, I found that she was very popular, and all the girls in the class liked her, while I could only watch in silence. Two months later, she would be nice to me one day and inexplicably give me the cold shoulder the next, and this coldness would last for a long time. This made me cry countless times. For her, I gave up all my friends around me, but I found that she always hurt me. I visited a psychologist, who prescribed medication, but even after taking it, I didn't feel better. This makes me feel that living in this world is meaningless. I have been suffering from depression for two years now, so why am I still alive?

Dr. Wu: Hugging you—seeing what happened to you feels like the past coming back. Please allow me to share my story with you in a sisterly tone. When I first went out of town for college, I met a girl I really admired. Independent, capable, with high emotional and intellectual intelligence, outgoing, and brave. She was a good roommate and a great best friend. We agreed at the start of school to prepare for graduate exams together, and since then we were inseparable. In front of her, I could be bold, positive, and loyal because she was my good friend. We went to class together, studied together, ate together, participated in activities together, did experiments together, and even slept together. We were as close as glue. You might wonder how someone in college could be so clingy. Looking back, maybe it was because I was alone in a new city, and having a close friend became addictive, haha. Those times were so pleasant and warm in my memory. I always thought it would continue like that, even choosing boyfriends from out of town so it wouldn’t affect the time with my best friend. But when I found out she had a boyfriend on campus, I was unexpectedly angry—angry enough to the point of cutting ties. Does that sound unreasonable? It turned out that in her world, I was so easily replaced, or perhaps I was never that important, or maybe I had no more utility. I was so disappointed that I withdrew into myself, wondering why I could accommodate everything for her, but she forgot me once she got a boyfriend. I didn’t know how I changed, becoming increasingly lonely while everyone else seemed to enjoy her company as usual, and I became more of a loner. I naturally distanced myself from everything related to her. I’d walk away at the mention of her, becoming fragile and unable to face her. Fortunately, when I changed dorms, I adapted to the new environment for a while, made new friends, and started feeling better. But it seemed my focus shifted towards studies, concentrating on my major courses and preparing for grad exams. It seemed like I was back to normal, but I knew deep down, I was lonelier. Yet, I was back on the path of progress. When I returned to my hometown and heard the news of my grandmother's passing, it felt like the sky had fallen. Nothing would stay for you, not even your closest kin. When I was struggling, those true friends offered a helping hand. I slowly realized that it was my selfishness, exaggerating my dependency on others while ignoring their care for me. I placed too much importance on emotions, overlooking the promises I should have fulfilled together. When you have a common goal, you’re never alone on the journey of striving for it. I am very grateful that my best friend still remembered me although I bore the pain of losing this friendship alone. I expressed it and got through it. Looking back, I've indeed been able to let go. Try a different teammate, aim for a different goal, try a different version of yourself—what's impossible? When you stop living in someone else's shadow, it won't matter as much. First, learn to care for yourself, take good care of yourself, and don't lose yourself.

Dr. Li is a professional counselor, and Xiao Na is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Na shared the following concern:

Client: I can't help but think about accidents or death all the time. I feel anxious and scared. I can't control my thoughts from drifting to terrible things. It's impossible not to think about it, and I feel very uncomfortable and afraid.

Dr. Li: Hello, dear questioner. For the current you, I wish to give you a warm hug. Psychological research shows that extreme emotionality often stems from prolonged anger and inferiority. This anger is not about hatred towards the outside world but rather dissatisfaction with oneself and the powerlessness in controlling one's environment. This immense chaos and loss of control within can easily extend to harm others or oneself. We must understand that life seldom goes entirely as planned; nobody has a lifetime devoid of dissatisfaction. Everyone experiences moments of unhappiness during which negative emotions lie dormant within, ready to stir. They quietly lurk in the shadows, contemplating our thoughts, waiting for a small opportunity to ignite disruption. As a result, one might feel despondent or explosively angry, possibly leading to harmful actions towards oneself or others. When we are dominated by such emotions, it's akin to a character in a martial arts novel losing control and being consumed by inner demons. Once these demons take hold, they can injure those around us, or ourselves. Conversely, when we can recognize and manage our emotions, control them, and adjust our feelings when negative emotions begin to stir, we can handle problems with different moods and approaches. John Milton once said, “A person who can control their emotions, desires, and fears is superior to all others. Emotions are inner demons; if you don't control them, they will consume you.” No matter what you encounter in life, remember that life is short; rather than letting emotions take control, adjust your mindset, let go of absolutist views, and try to look at people and things optimistically, becoming the master of your emotions. “Smile in the face of adversity, take gains and losses lightly” and scientifically view emotions, differentiate their types, manage them well, so you can spend each day happily.

Dr. Chen is a professional counselor, and Xiao Mei is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Mei shared the following concern:

Client: Should I go to work with depression caused by work stress? Due to work pressure (working over ten hours a day), being far from home (200 kilometers away), having my wife and child at home (married for seven months), low salary (1900 yuan), and a boss who doesn’t allow me to return home (only allows two days to go home), even though it’s a state-owned enterprise, it doesn't look anything like one. As a result, I now have depression. I don't even know if I can take leave. Even if I can, my family hopes I go back, but right now I'm very afraid to go back. I want to escape and am afraid my situation will worsen. My boss is also urging me to return home, and since everyone thinks I should, I don’t want to talk to anyone now. What exactly should I do? Should I go back or take leave to get proper treatment?

Dr. Chen: Hello, ————————————————— From your description of your work and family situation, I can sense you desire to spend time with your wife and children, yet you feel unhappy with your current job. Your main discomfort seems to stem from work: "Although it's a state-owned enterprise, it doesn't resemble one at all." This sentence is somewhat unclear and may not align with your expectations. Additionally, your salary is low, only 1900 RMB. The distance from home and the fact that your boss doesn't allow you to return home contribute to your misery. Your family currently does not understand your pain and insists you should continue working. Have you considered why they want you to go back to work? ————————————————— On a development level, you are in the newlywed stage, having established a family and career, working in a state-owned enterprise which should be less stressful compared to private companies. However, you feel oppressed and uncomfortable, so do you have interpersonal issues? I believe you should first clarify your goal: do you want to change jobs, seek family understanding, or treat depressive emotions? I suggest having a deep conversation with your family to clearly express your goals, then discuss together how to handle the situation, and conduct a mental health assessment. If it's just an issue of social adaptation, you should continue working to build resilience. ————————————————— In summary, my suggestions are: (1) Start with a mental health assessment to confirm if your psychological discomfort is affecting your normal social activities. If the impact is mild, after achieving understanding and communication with your family, you should return to work. Whether to return to your previous job can be decided after considering both your family's and your own goals. If the impact is severe, I recommend psychological counseling and treatment first, then decide when to return to work based on the treatment outcome. (2) You need to establish a correct worldview and values. As a man and a husband, engaging in necessary social work is your responsibility and duty, which you need to face and execute properly. You may not yet have learned how to interact with various leaders or colleagues, but don't easily give up. Set a small goal, like working happily for a week and see if it works. If successful, extend it for another week. This approach may help you begin to integrate into social work. ————————————————— Above all, I wish you a happy life, and good luck!

Dr. Wu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Lan is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Lan shared the following concern:

Client: I want to find someone from my memories to confide in, but what should I do if I can't accept Gestalt therapy? 

Hello, teachers. After a period of psychological counseling, I feel that the people from my memories are so precious. However, most of them have already parted ways with me or moved on to their own journeys. I can no longer find them to say the things I want to say from my heart. Yet, I struggle to accept Gestalt therapy—I understand it as talking to myself about my feelings. What can I do?

Dr. Wu: Hello, questioner. When we are restricted in some way and can't reach out to others or express our feelings to them, it can feel like our emotions are bottled up. Human emotions need to be expressed so that our energy can flow. In psychology counseling, there are some methods to express these emotions. One method I particularly like is "writing a letter to the other person." This is a form of writing therapy. Writing therapy involves documenting past experiences, feelings, and things we wish to express but can't, through writing, to achieve healing. It has some similarities with narrative therapy. During the process of narration, one undergoes self-exposure, which in itself is therapeutic. Find a safe environment to write a letter to the other person. The content of the letter isn’t restricted; you can write what you want to say to them, and your emotions. After writing, you can read the letter aloud and observe how you feel before and after. Of course, this letter doesn’t necessarily have to be sent. If you can read it to someone you trust and who listens well, that's also effective. This method is simple and convenient, requiring little time and environment constraints, and can be done alone. The unique aspect of writing is that it is tangible. You can see your inner feelings through your words, which is a process of deepening self-understanding. In my writing therapy experiences, I have felt the immense power that words hold. Writing is a mirror letting me view myself from a certain distance. Another method is a Gestalt therapy technique called the "empty chair" technique. In emotion-focused therapy, the empty chair technique is also an important intervention method, helping clients ease internal conflicts and express emotions better. The empty chair dialogue technique is generally used to help clients address emotions toward significant others in their lives. You can prepare two chairs, sit in one, and imagine the important person sitting in the other chair. Then express your thoughts and emotions to that person. Next, you can sit in the opposite chair, imagine being that person, and respond to your initial expression. With a counselor's assistance, after the client fully expresses their emotions, the counselor provides emotional validation, helping them understand that such emotions are normal and assists them in replacing maladaptive emotions with adaptive ones. Completing this process on your own might not reveal the whole issue, as you may be limited by your perspective, but practicing by yourself can still be helpful. You mentioned you couldn’t accept Gestalt therapy’s method of talking to yourself about your feelings. I assume you're referring to the "dialogue exercise" technique within Gestalt therapy. The empty chair technique I mentioned belongs to Gestalt therapy but differs in that the client plays both roles. This technique is essentially a form of role-play, externalizing introjections, allowing a full experience of conflicts and exploring hidden emotions. The emphasis is on the experience. Another method is role-playing with someone you trust, similar to the empty chair technique. Having a counselor assist you in this process is even better, as someone responding to you can provide a broader perspective. Additionally, analyzing your dreams can be a valuable method. From personal experience, I sometimes dream of deceased relatives, and within the dreams, I can analyze some of my internal complexes. Changes in dreams can reflect internal changes in a person. Dream interpretation is a core technique in psychoanalytic schools of thought. Try recording and analyzing your dreams to deepen self-understanding. These are my suggestions; I hope they help you. Blessings to you.

Dr. Liu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Lan is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Lan shared the following concern:

Client: 17-year-old, severely depressed, aware that my mom wants to care for me but still can't control myself. I went to the hospital and was diagnosed with severe depression. I know my mom is very worried about me and that she sometimes cries secretly. However, because she had me at an older age, there's a significant age gap between us, and she's completely unable to understand my thoughts. I know that if I break down, my mom will too, so I can only force myself to hold it together. What should I do?

Dr. Liu: Your mom is unable to understand your ideas, which could potentially lead to your breaking down. If you break down, she might break down too. This is a normal behavior. If your ideas need her support to be realized and she can't understand them, it's quite normal. After all, there's a big age difference between you, and your ways of thinking differ. So, how about this? When you find your ideas are beyond her understanding but need her support, temporarily let go of seeking her support. Keep your ideas, write them down; wait until you can support yourself or someone else can support you, then take action. Your frustration comes from having to implement your current ideas that require her support. Since she can't understand you, try narrowing the scope of your actions and ideas to areas she can understand, so at least you can coexist peacefully. When you go to college and have control over some funds, you'll likely be able to act according to your ideas. Sometimes, you need to delay satisfying your own needs to avoid immediate conflict. If you need to communicate, you can leave a message or send a private message.

Dr. Sun is a professional counselor, and Xiao Jun is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Jun shared the following concern:

Client: There are problems at home, and I like a girl. I'm afraid of "repeating" pain. What should I do? I'm a male freshman in college. There's a girl in my class who's lively and active. She comes from a loving family and hasn't really seen dark things. I heard that once, an elementary school child was told "get lost" by a parent, and she was shocked, saying it meant losing parental love... I think she might not know much about caring for others. Also, would someone who grew up in such an environment later refuse to express themselves because they never felt the need to before?

Suddenly, I'm terrified of being triggered and repeating past pain. It seems possible, but I don’t know if it's my tendency to avoid that’s still at play... On the other hand, I often doubt myself, feeling so empty. We come from completely different worlds, and I don't know if we can get along well. I also doubt if I'm worthy... In the past, I developed a strong, serious demeanor, kind of like "keeping strangers at a distance," and I'm not good at chatting with others anymore, though I'm working on improving that.

I've noticed that in my usual state (which others describe as unapproachable), her reactions towards me seem more pronounced than towards others, like her steps become more awkward. A few others do too, but not as seriously. Now I feel a bit confused. I don't know if the relationship can develop, nor do I know how to develop it, or how to break this suffocating demeanor of mine. I've been reminding myself to think of happy things and laugh more often, and my laughter is becoming much more natural than before.

Dr. Sun: You've spent quite a bit of time understanding your mom and dad's personalities in your family situation before you gradually found a way to handle things, right? This approach is also very useful when it comes to dating. You can get to know her first, then try pursuing her. You still have three years in college. Isn't it first about considering how to win her over? Then, by the time you're in your third year, you might face your respective family situations. This means you have three years to think about how to deal with your own family or hers, right? You know yourself and partly know her, so it's normal to have this or that concern; because finding a solution requires motivation, right? You’ve already changed as described in this text; you've met someone different from anyone in your past environment. The patterns you developed in the past were to cope with past environments; when the environment changes, your coping patterns will also change, which is quite normal, isn’t it? Now is the time to broaden your horizons, as different people will shape different interaction environments. You need to experience different environments now; she's doing the same, broadening her horizons too. So shouldn't you focus on finding the right solutions for the issues you’ve raised yourself? If you need to communicate, feel free to leave a message or send me a private message.

Dr. Xu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Jun is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Jun shared the following concern:

Client: I hate him, yet I can't help but reach out to him. Should I get a divorce? My husband and I were high school classmates; we've known each other for more than ten years. When we dated as students, I felt he could endlessly tolerate my bad temper. I could hit him, scold him, and he would accept it, leading me to mistakenly believe he had a good temper. During the two years we lived together before marriage, he hit me twice. The first time was when he came back late after drinking; I got angry and hit him first, then he hit me back in a rage. The second time, I was in a bad mood and provoked him in front of friends, and he hit me again. Yet, we still got married. During my postpartum confinement, because he did nothing and irritated me, I kicked him, and he slapped me in front of my mother. The day before yesterday, because he came back late, constantly deceiving me, and my parents were taking care of our child, I didn't want to wake them, so I told him not to pull me back to our room to sleep; I wanted to sleep with the child. He didn't listen, so I called his mother, and he got furious, kicking the door madly. When my parents came out, somehow he ended up fighting with my dad. My father had been hospitalized for two months this year and was still recovering. I called the police, but no case was filed. He was detained overnight, released, and didn't come home. I hate him, but I can't stop contacting him. I desperately need someone to comfort and hold me.

Dr. Xu: My husband and I were high school classmates. We've known each other for over ten years. Back when we were students, I felt he could endlessly tolerate my bad temper — hitting him, yelling at him — he would accept it all. But your living environment now is different from when you were students. Both you and he are married now; he has to bear the expenses for you and your child, and his pressure outside should be considerable, especially during this year's pandemic. He's no longer in a student environment where all he has to worry about is studying and accommodating you. Your perception of his state is still stuck in the student era, but he has already moved beyond it. Are you still using the same methods with him? Do you think it will work? Your environment has changed significantly, yet you seem unaware? You're now a mother, with a child. Your husband can also manage on his own. Are you still living in the student era? Let's play a thought game. If you maintain your current state and he proposes "divorce," or you can't tolerate him continuing to be "violent" towards you (many instances of his violence are provoked by you), what do you plan to do? Have you considered this issue? If you want to avoid conflicts with him, could you change the way you treat him? Would that solve the problem? Previously, you've always used "violence" towards him, and now he's simply using "violence" as a way to communicate with you. He's mimicking your method of communication; so, if you change your approach, would he also learn? If you need to talk, you can leave a message or send a private message.

Dr. Zhang is a professional counselor, and Xiao Qiang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Qiang shared the following concern:

Client: My boyfriend had a messy past and loves to lie, and I've become controlling and exhausted from the relationship. We met through a matchmaker. At first glance, I felt we weren't compatible, but over time, I got used to it. Our family backgrounds, education, and work differ greatly—we're two different types of people. I never used to check his phone or care where he went. Over six months into our relationship, I discovered that in the past, he had posted hookup ads and his Weibo username, "xx persevere without failing," and he shared inappropriate content like a guy dating two girls simultaneously. His phone had chat records with prostitutes from 2017-2018 and images of women at spa centers exposed in towels. During the New Year pandemic period, he downloaded many videos of beautiful women from Douyin. I was unaware of these things. We've fought many times and nearly broken up because of this, but I'm a conservative girl—I gave him my first time and wanted to cherish it, so I forgave him multiple times and didn't break up. Then this October, I saw a prostitute in his phone's blacklist, with a name including "xx home service." I asked who that was and why they were in his blacklist, and he said he didn’t know and couldn’t explain clearly. Without concrete evidence, the matter was brushed aside. Later, I installed an app on his phone to see his whereabouts anytime, but I still struggle to trust him. I'm so exhausted by this relationship.

Dr. Zhang: Anyone encountering such a man needs to strengthen their sense of control; it's normal because his behavior doesn't provide a sense of security. #You gave him your first time, so cherish it and put up with him multiple times without breaking up. #Giving him your first time doesn't mean he is 'good.' From your understanding, he is not suitable for 'marriage' at this stage. #We met through a blind date. At first sight, I felt we weren't a match, but later I got used to it. There is a big difference in our family backgrounds, education, and work. We are two different types of people. #You already know that your spirits are not aligned; if you try to immerse yourself in his world, you'll become more 'controlling,' spending a lot of time 'monitoring' his whereabouts daily, which drains your energy. So do you have no choice, or do you think he'll 'change' just because you gave your first time to him? From your description, it seems he's just someone with a strong sexual desire, spending his leisure time seeking different women for sex. He doesn't value 'people,' he values his sexual desires. You can continue the current situation but make sure to practice 'safe sex' to prevent accidental pregnancy, which would increase the 'cost' of leaving. If you're too exhausted to continue, you can choose to end the relationship. Understanding someone takes time, and you've already spent quite a bit. Sometimes leaving him might give you the opportunity to meet a 'better' person, right? If you need to communicate, feel free to leave a message or send a private message.

Dr. Wang is a professional counselor, and Xiao Fang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Fang shared the following concern:

Client: Should I give up pursuing absolute security and focus on my work amid risks? I used to live happily, believing the world was beautiful and being proactive in my career. However, two years ago, after feeling overly confident, I made mistakes and engaged in multiple commercial sexual activities. Initially, I was terrified of AIDS. I tested several times and was negative, which relieved some of my fear. Yet, during the COVID pandemic when I worked from home, I had more time to learn about AIDS. I found out that it can spread through wounds, and even though the chance is small, it's still theoretically possible! My fear keeps growing; I'm afraid to go to public places if I have wounds on my hands. It's one thing if I got infected myself, but my biggest worry is that if I get infected and pass it on to my children, their lives would be ruined! Now, I'm nearly unable to work; whenever I try to start working, a voice in my head reminds me to check for recent wounds on my hands, whether I've come into contact with any public objects or facilities, and what if I get infected, what then? I've reflected on this, and it seems I might be seeking absolute security, but this world probably doesn't have absolute security. I'm seeking help: How can I let go of the need for absolute security and still focus on my work despite the risks?

Dr. Wang: Hello, I'm glad to meet you and offer my assistance. Based on your text, I can sense your inner unease and anxiety. As you mentioned, despite being in a favorable phase of life, you've deviated from your path after engaging in paid sexual activity. You're deeply regretful and have awakened to fears of infectious diseases, particularly HIV, and the worry of transmitting it to your family. Although tests have ruled out infection, your concerns linger. This state of fear and anxiety has shown signs of expansion and extension, a psychological phenomenon known as generalization, which disrupts your daily life and affects its quality.

No one is perfect; everyone makes mistakes. Learning from them is a profound virtue. What has happened can't be undone, and time won't reverse due to our will. Given this, perhaps it's best to release the burden of these thoughts, let go of the past, and focus on the present. Approach life's uncertainties with a positive and optimistic outlook. It's human instinct to seek benefit and avoid harm. Fear of disease stems from an individual's health awareness. We fear darkness and yearn for sunlight to fill the world. We dread cold and hope for the warmth of the sun. We fear danger and dream of lifelong safety. After encountering danger, our instinct for safety is triggered, and a natural sense of self-protection arises. Discussing your current psychological state is a normal phenomenon. It's essential to maintain a calm perspective.

No matter how tumultuous the external world might be, if our inner self is peaceful and determined, our entire being will be energized. Returning to the essence of living, safety is a relative concept. Life's unpredictabilities illustrate this relativity poignantly—the sky has unforeseeable storms, and humans face sudden fortunes or misfortunes. Regardless of whether you are in safety or danger, maintaining inner stability is crucial. Since absolute safety cannot be assured, live naturally with your anxiety, do what you love, cherish those around you, and strive for your family and career, which reflect life's beauty. Cultivate a positive mindset, adopt a healthy lifestyle, and focus more on the positive aspects of life. Gradually, your inner strength will grow. Life presents various temptations, and when we're confused, selfishness and greed in our hearts find openings. While kind to yourself, be vigilant against straying from life's path. I hope this brings some insight and wish you health and happiness.

Dr. Wang is a professional counselor, and Xiao Jun is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Jun shared the following concern:

Client: I have to go on another blind date, and my mood feels a bit like interviewing for a job—so helpless. This time, the person is four years older than me. The biggest age difference before was just one year. I can’t help but start imagining and worrying. He’s nearly 40, perhaps very mature, and I, in front of him, am like a child. My self-assessment is that my psychological age is not mature enough. Also, I usually don't bother with my appearance, often looking disheveled. I should tidy up a bit this time. It really feels like an interview, caring about others' opinions. You just have to put in the effort like this. I really dislike going on blind dates this way, but there’s no choice other than this. When a blind date turns into an interview, how can there be any romance? I know my role is just to show up. There won't be any further connection. At this point in my life, I don’t want any interference from others! A one-time meeting just feels like a waste of time and energy for both parties…so helpless…

Dr. Wang: Hello, it seems like you're about to go on a blind date, and your feelings are similar to attending an interview: a bit nervous and a bit worried. You really dislike this feeling. Blind dates are supposed to be simple, something light and enjoyable. Even though you're communicating with someone you don't know, as long as you show your true self, that's sufficient. But it seems like you're very concerned about the other person's evaluation of you and hope to present your best side. This puts a lot of pressure on you, making it hard to feel any joy in the process. Your approach to blind dating seems to be just to make an appearance, with no intention of further interaction, and currently, you don't want anyone else involved in your life. However, deep down, you're still longing to meet someone destined, right? That's why, even under such circumstances, you’re willing to go on a blind date. I think you can completely relax a bit more and not worry too much about the other person's judgment. Just showing your true self is enough. You could approach it with the mindset of meeting new friends, and maybe during this process, you'll really meet that destined person. Best wishes~.

Dr. Wu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Fang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Fang shared the following concern:

Client: Why would a mother be jealous of her daughter? What should I do? It's been many years, and I just realized that my mom is envious of me. She compares everything with me, and in everything, I can't surpass her. I have a stubborn nature; could it be that in her mind, my being disobedient equates to not loving her, equals competing with her, so she feels the need to suppress me in every aspect? In the beginning, I didn't understand and didn't listen to her. Later, I saw my grandma being obedient and submissive at home, yet not treated well, so I thought that if I were obedient, I'd also be bullied. No matter how much my mom hit or scolded me, I endured it. Though she disliked me, it allowed me to do what I wanted. Was I wrong? For so many years, I never understood why people always want to coerce me into listening to them. If I don't, they dislike me and make things difficult for me. Do I have to become an obedient and submissive person for others to treat me well? There was a time I tried listening to my mom, but she just enjoyed controlling me and didn’t treat me well either. What should I do? I don't want to be an obedient puppet—I want to do things according to my own will. Isn't that right? How can I act according to my own desires without making my mom and those around me dislike me?

Dr. Wu: Hello, I saw your question and I tried to organize my thoughts. I have identified several areas of confusion you might be experiencing: 

1. Your mother constantly compares you with others, wants you to be better in every way, and suppresses you. You don’t understand why and wonder if it's because you're disobedient that she treats you like this.

2. You are disobedient because you want to act according to your own ideas, but this makes you unpopular with those around you. People seem to dislike you and make things difficult for you. You’re uncertain if only by being compliant can you gain their favor.

3. You wish to be yourself while also being liked by others and are unsure if there is a way to achieve both. Is this correct?

Let’s discuss your confusion point by point: 

1. There truly are mothers who are jealous of their own children; these mothers typically have narcissistic personality tendencies. In the book "The Bonds of Maternal Love," the author lists nine characteristics of those with narcissistic traits, one being frequently jealous of others and displaying an arrogant, dismissive attitude. I recommend that you read this book to see if your relationship with your mother aligns with how it is described. If your mother indeed has a narcissistic personality, then regardless of whether you are obedient or rebellious, it is difficult for you to be truly seen by her, as she can only see herself; her world revolves solely around herself with no space for others.

2. You think people don’t like you because you aren’t obedient enough. I’m curious to know who specifically these people are. Is it that everyone you encounter expects you to be compliant? Have you ever met anyone who doesn’t pressure you to obey? I admire you for how you manage to persist in being yourself despite this pressure. How do you feel and what are your thoughts after insisting on being yourself? You mentioned that at first, you chose to be disobedient because you saw your grandmother being bullied despite being very compliant, and you felt that even listening to your mother’s words didn’t earn her love and care, only leaving you with a sense of being controlled. So, you chose not to be obedient. Do you feel that being obedient is equivalent to being bullied, while disobedience seems not to guarantee freedom from being targeted or bullied either? Are you unsure of how to face this situation? Here’s a hug for you. I sense that you want to be liked and accepted by others, yet now you don't know what you should do to earn this liking and acceptance. Is that right? I invite you to imagine: if you could earn everyone’s liking, how would your life change? What differences would there be compared to now? Is that the life you long for?

3. It seems that you have placed being yourself and being liked by others on opposite ends of a balance, striving to find a way to have both. Adlerian psychology scholar Ichiro Kishimi wrote a famous book called "The Courage to be Disliked." In this book, he states that so-called freedom means no longer seeking approval, even if it means being disliked by others. If you wish to exercise freedom, a price must be paid. The cost of freedom in social relationships is being disliked by others. To remain unaffected by others’ judgments, to not fear being disliked, to not seek others’ approval—without paying these costs, one cannot truly live according to their own lifestyle, nor achieve freedom. Seeking approval is human instinct, whereas freedom is the ability to oppose instinct. I genuinely applaud you because you’ve been on a journey to seek freedom, always possessing the courage to be disliked. Even if you’re currently bewildered and troubled, I believe that you’ll rediscover the original intention of being true to yourself once the fog clears.

Moreover, I wish to add that every child hopes to receive unconditional love and care from their mother, although reality can be harsh, and not all mothers have the capacity to provide such unconditional love. Realizing this might make you feel sad, angry, or experience other emotions, but no matter what the emotion is, please allow yourself to accept it and face it with the courage to be yourself. This emotion will help you further explore your true self and allow it to function in your own way. This is freedom.

Dr. Liu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Wei is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Wei shared the following concern:

Client: A 17-year-old orphan likes me online, how can I help her? There's a friend of mine on a voice chatting app who likes me because of my pleasant voice and good temper. She used to visit my room every day to chat and hang out with friends. I was curious why she always wanted to find a partner there, and she would come to me crying every time she got dumped, saying she wanted to leave and didn't want to live anymore, until last week… She got dumped again and started crying and cutting her wrists with a knife. I was at a loss and agreed to be with her temporarily. (I really just wanted to help her out, I'm not romantically interested in her, I just didn't want her to commit suicide.) So last night I told her, "You know, this won't lead anywhere, it will only end up hurting both of us. I'll be your good friend, staying by your side and comforting you..." Then she completely broke down, and I found out her dad had an affair three years ago and had another child, her parents divorced and kept it from her for a year, and when they told her, both her mom and dad said they didn't want her anymore. Now her grandparents and aunt in another province are supporting her through high school… She's really powerless. I really want to help her, but I never thought I would hurt her this way. I'm so scared she'll commit suicide, I know she needs to find her own way out of the darkness, but she needs help! She deleted me, and now I feel incredibly guilty and scared, I don't know what to do.

Dr. Liu: This friend has experienced family upheaval and trauma, leading to negative perceptions and emotions about family ties and intimate relationships. Her parents' actions made her feel abandoned and unloved, leaving her internally lonely and helpless, lacking love and a sense of security. As a result, she consistently seeks affection through relationships and attempts to find fulfillment of love through the internet. When these needs aren't met, and when she is abandoned by others, it reignites the harm her parents once inflicted on her. Hence, she resorts to self-harm as a way to inflict self-punishment and to vent her painful emotions. You gave her warmth and affection, making her rely heavily on and trust you, viewing you as an emotional support. Was she the one who initially suggested being in a relationship? Her actions reflect her searching for an emotional substitute and anchor. However, when you explained the need to separate and only remain friends, it once again triggered feelings of abandonment, leading to her breakdown. Acknowledge that your good intentions and initial desire were to help her, yet previously you weren't fully aware of her situation and true emotional needs, leading to concessions and inappropriate help. But this is beyond your ability to control and change. The reasons behind her emotional breakdown and extreme behavior extend beyond you; they stem from her own precarious and near-collapse state. In psychology, such situations typically require professional psychological crisis intervention and guidance to help her move forward. She's already deleted you; do you know any alternative ways to contact her? Or do you have her personal contact information? You could try reaching out to her and listen to her feelings, providing her with contact information for local psychological crisis intervention services. Additionally, try reporting the situation to the dating app platform's customer service, asking for them to follow up and offer appropriate help. You lack professional crisis intervention skills and have done what you can, leaving the rest to professionals. You've done your best, and how she chooses to proceed, whether she can be helped and move past this, is her issue now. Don't take all the responsibility upon yourself, and avoid excessive self-blame. Best wishes~.

Dr. Zhang is a professional counselor, and Xiao Yu is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Yu shared the following concern:

Client: Freshman year, not on the same wavelength as my roommates, how should I get along with them? It's been half a year as a freshman, and I'm not on the same wavelength as my roommates. Sometimes I feel isolated! What should I do? My roommates often play LOL late at night, which makes me anxious and affects my classes the next day. How can I get along better with my roommates?

Dr. Zhang: Without saying anything, let's give the original poster a hug first. It's been half a year as a freshman, but I'm not on the same wavelength as my roommates; in the dorm, I often feel isolated; my roommates often stay up gaming late, and it's affecting my anxiety and keeping me from sleeping; insomnia then affects the next day's classes; I'm not sure how to interact with my roommates. With so many intertwined worries, I can feel your sadness, helplessness, and confusion. Hugging you again. Half a year as a freshman has passed, and you have realized the different rhythms with your roommates. What do you usually do? Have you observed what your roommates usually do? Do you approve of what your roommates do? Everyone has their own understanding and goals. If you did the same things as your roommates, would you reach your plans or goals? If you want to join that small group of other roommates, you might try doing similar things, have common topics, and go to the same places together. Observe or understand if your roommates have any taboos and avoid stepping on their toes in daily life or studies. You mentioned your roommates play League of Legends late; you might try it yourself, experience the fun, and relax a bit, which might help you understand why they stay up late gaming. But you need to control this, not get addicted and forget your initial intentions; maybe when you feel tired or it's time for you to sleep, just tell your roommates, "I can't stay up; I'm tired; I want to sleep. Are you sleeping too? If staying up, please keep it down, I'm afraid of the noise." (This requires a bit of verbal tact.) Being disturbed by roommates at night is really painful; I've been through it. I even talked to a teacher about it back then. The advice I received was quite specific. When I was disturbed, I said, "Can you keep it down?" This "you" was general. So when you identify which roommate is loud, you can be specific, like saying "XX, can you keep it down? I want to sleep now." However, I failed back then because we had a good relationship in the dorm, and I felt embarrassed to say anything. Later, I bought earplugs, listened to music with a timer, turned up the volume until I couldn't hear them, or simply stayed up with them. Because we know the external environment can't be controlled by us. When we can't change our surroundings, we need to adapt to better fit in. It may take some time to adapt, but feeling "isolated" (seeming not very sociable now) can be very uncomfortable, and if we don't adapt, it may take even longer. Of course, you can also empower yourself, become a unique and independent person, quietly becoming stronger and eventually amaze everyone. ————————— These are my thoughts and some personal experiences; I hope they can give you a bit of inspiration. Remember, you are not alone; the world and I love you.

Dr. Li is a professional counselor, and Xiao Yu is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Yu shared the following concern:

Client: My husband likes the silent treatment, and during this time, I feel extremely anxious and uncomfortable. What's going on? Every time we have a conflict, it's over small issues. My husband is quite sensitive and has a strong sense of self-esteem. If I'm not careful with my words, he gets angry. In the past, I was also concerned about saving face, so we'd both engage in the silent treatment. Later, my friends advised me that this wasn't good for my health, so I decided I didn't want to continue with the silent treatment anymore. When he gets upset, I ask him what's wrong, and usually, the issue gets resolved. After the pandemic, he hasn't been working for over six months. His previous job downsized, and he doesn't want to go back to his old line of work. So, he's been at home for six months, unable to find a suitable job. It's not that he can't find work; it's more that nothing seems quite right. He doesn't like what people around him suggest, and he can't find direction on his own. Yesterday after work, we argued about something small — he hasn't gotten a haircut despite me mentioning it several times before. I told him he'd look more refreshed with a haircut, but he might not prioritize his appearance and feels that frequent haircuts cost money. He isn't really under financial pressure, though, and he got upset. Maybe he felt I was criticizing him. Later on, I asked if he was angry, and he replied he didn't want to talk to me. I feel particularly hurt and uncomfortable because even though he's unemployed, I haven't said much about it and still try to care for his emotions. Yet, he ignores me, which drives me crazy. When others argue, they can go about their own business, but I feel really troubled. I don't know what to do.

Dr. Li: Hello! I read your description and understand that whenever there are issues in your marriage, he resorts to "cold violence," which you find unacceptable. I can sense how uncomfortable, oppressed, and even angry you feel at the moment. Sending you a hug! During conflicts, men often use passive responses to avoid being overwhelmed by emotions, while women seek emotional confrontation. If both parties cannot understand each other, it can lead to more intense hostility. If we can resolve these issues one by one, the relationship will become much more harmonious. You mentioned that the problems eventually get resolved. Good communication can gradually reduce the frequency of these "silent wars." Have you ever expressed to him: "When you don't talk to me (observation), I feel very sad (feeling), I want to talk with you (need), and I hope you can understand me (request)?" The recent conflict you described was triggered by unemployment. In marriage, men often place a significant emphasis on their ability to support the family, so he might be under a lot of pressure now, even if he doesn't express it strongly. At this moment, he is more in need of your understanding and support. 1. Focus on his positive traits (if you're overwhelmed with sadness now, think about what attracted you to him initially and the happy times you had), and encourage him more; 2. Try to avoid using a judgmental, blaming, or critical tone; 3. People can only change themselves, not others. The world and I love you! 💛💛💛.

Dr. Zhao is a professional counselor, and Xiao Qiang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Qiang shared the following concern:

Client: We have two kids; the younger one is 1.5 years old and has recently become very clingy to mom. Why is that? Both parents work every day, and the older child goes to kindergarten. The grandmother takes care of the younger one at home. Previously, when going to work, the little one wasn’t very clingy and didn’t fuss. However, recently, whenever at home, the child wants to be held all the time, even when going to the bathroom. During work hours, the child cries continuously. Hearing the crying is particularly frustrating, and I just want to slam the door and escape from the house. Several times, I've lost my temper and scolded harshly, but after the scolding, I still have to continue holding the child... Today, I hid in the bed at home and listened to the little one playing happily alone. Why does the child keep crying only in my presence?

Dr. Zhao: Hello, Poster! Your baby is one and a half years old and has suddenly become clingy, wanting you to hold him at home and crying if you don’t? Does he also cry when you go to work? You don’t understand why he keeps crying in front of you, and his crying makes you lose your temper, wanting to scold him harshly, but after scolding, you still continue to hold him. You're not sure why he is so attached to you. First, let's understand the characteristics of a baby at this stage: — At one and a half years old, a baby's language development is still immature, and most of their needs are expressed through crying. The crying of a one and a half-year-old can be due to hunger, cold, pain, fatigue, toys being taken away, fear, or shock. So, is your child crying in front of you just because he wants you to hold him? Or does he have other unmet needs? — From six months old, a baby develops a special emotional bond with the primary caregiver (usually the mother) and feels particularly happy when with the mother, crying when she leaves. During this period, the baby may experience "separation anxiety." Unable to predict whether his mother will return after leaving, the baby uses crying to resist separation. So, how should we respond? * As a mother, learn to control your emotions, as scolding could frighten the baby. * Respond promptly to your child's crying, trying to help him express his needs: “Is the baby crying because he doesn’t want to leave mommy?” or “Did someone take the toy the baby wants to play with?” In responding, you can gradually soothe the baby's emotions. * If the baby experiences "separation anxiety," you can play games like “Mommy goes to work, bye-bye!” and “Mommy is back, are you happy?” with your baby, letting him know that mommy will return after going to work, which can help alleviate his anxiety.

Dr. Wu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Qiang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Qiang shared the following concern:

Client: Studying diligently, can reading really bring me the life I want? I am a junior in college. I always had good grades in high school, but I messed up the college entrance exam. Now I'm at a non-prestigious university, but it actually has strong capabilities. My grades in college are still okay, and I'm planning to apply for a master's program in the UK. However, recently I've been feeling lost. I'm studying a science and engineering major, and to be honest, it's really exhausting to study seriously in college, and it's quite dull too.

Lately, I've started to envy a few friends from my hometown. They didn't have good grades; some even went to technical colleges, and some are at joint international programs (you know what I mean). But they seem to have such rich lives... going to bars in the evening for fun, playing mahjong in the afternoon, but they're not just wasting their time. They actually meet a lot of people and have a wide social circle. Their families are somewhat well-off, and they have high emotional intelligence, so I think their future prospects aren't bad.

As for me, I’m the kind of person who studies honestly every day, which is exhausting, and my life isn't that colorful. I don't meet as many people, and I feel like my current lifestyle isn't very satisfying. Actually, I felt this way in high school too, but back then I had the goal of getting into my dream university, which was motivating. But now, even if I study abroad in the UK and come back to this same dull life, it seems pointless...

Dr. Wu: Hello, dear poster, here's a "confident" hug for you! I've carefully sorted through your thoughts: let's take a look at this situation. You're a junior in college. You did very well in high school, but unfortunately didn't perform as well on the college entrance exam. Now you're attending a university that's not highly ranked, but it's quite strong in its own right. Your university grades are okay, and you're planning to apply for a master's program in the UK. You feel a bit lost. You're studying a science and engineering major, which can be quite exhausting if you delve into it seriously, and it's also pretty dull. 

Your hometown friends, who didn't have great academic results, are attending either vocational schools or expensive private colleges, but they have rich social lives... going to bars, playing mahjong, expanding their connections, with decent family backgrounds and high emotional intelligence. You think their future won't be too bad compared to yours—you feel like the bookworm type, which is exhausting, with a less vibrant life and no connections, feeling unsatisfied with your current state. You felt like this in high school too, but back then you believed in getting into an ideal university, which kept you motivated. Now, you think that even if you study abroad in the UK and come back to the same monotonous life, it would be meaningless.

I'd like to invite you to analyze this together: I see a few discrepancies. Did the college entrance exam have a significant impact on you? Your grades were good, but underperformance led to a mismatch between effort and result; this is the first discrepancy. You're studying science and engineering, which is tough and monotonous, and you're uncertain about the future. Meanwhile, your friends back home, though attending vocational or joint-venture schools and living a vibrant social life, don't seem to worry about their future being worse off. Yet another mismatch between effort and reward; this is the second.

Your motivation in high school came from aiming for an ideal university. After that dream shattered, you made an equal exchange, thinking that even studying abroad in the UK would lead to the same dull life upon return, making it seem meaningless. Child, do you know? You're too tired. You're exhausted both physically and mentally. When you're tired, the best approach is to take a break and then return to a state of striving. What's at the core of learning? It's thinking! Science and engineering require even more thinking. Everyone has their own way of life, so play to your strengths and move along the path that suits you! Study well, make good progress! With every effort comes a reward.

Dr. Sun is a professional counselor, and Xiao Ming is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Ming shared the following concern:

Client: Afraid of not finding a job? Yet also afraid of working? Confident or insecure? Approaching 30, I'm not afraid of this phase, but due to various reasons, I've been resting for 8 months now. Honestly, aside from the initial anxiety, I've completely embraced this state recently and am ready to re-enter the job market. However, I've found that job hunting isn't as smooth as I imagined. Some positions I'm afraid to apply for, and for those I've applied to, there's been no response. I don't know if it's an age issue. Friends around me are advising me to have a baby first, since age is a factor, but personally, I don't want a child right now. I fear not finding a job and feeling useless, yet I'm also somewhat afraid of working and repeating the same routine daily. The truth is, I don't know what I want. On one hand, I'm worried that it will get harder because of my age; on the other hand, I don't know how to change things.

Dr. Sun: Hello! I understand your concerns. Approaching 30 and wanting to re-enter the workforce after an 8-month break, you're a bit afraid of not finding a job, and also a bit afraid of the monotony of working every day. I want to share my perspective with you, hoping it might inspire you. Take a moment to calm down and ask yourself what kind of life you truly want. Everyone might face such concerns at some point—unsure of what they want to do, worried about age, and so on. Each person has different answers. For example, some women choose to be full-time housewives, some strive in their careers to realize their value, and others are content to have a simple job to be financially independent. At this point, you really need to ask yourself what you value most and what is most important to you. By prioritizing aspects like career, work, family, having children, etc., you’ll gradually clarify your choices. Perhaps no one can walk two paths simultaneously, so we generally need to make a choice. Once you've made your choice, just strive toward it. Suppose you opt to look for a job; this year, job opportunities might indeed be tougher than previous years. However, as long as you are willing to search and considering you have some work experience, I'm confident you'll find something. Sometimes, the first job you find may not be ideal, but it can be a good stepping stone. The enhancement of skills is the core competitive edge in today's society. Professionals with technical skills or those who can continuously learn and enhance their strengths have great development prospects. When we face setbacks, it's inevitable to have some self-doubt, but it seems you still have confidence. Believe in yourself, as everyone has the potential to grow, and some even achieve significant successes across different fields. I recommend a book to you: "Leapfrogging Growth," which talks about reshaping life's possibilities and turning "midlife crises" into "midlife opportunities" through mental shifts. You're still very young, not even at midlife yet. I wish you a swift resolution to your dilemmas and a happy and joyful life!

Dr. Chen is a professional counselor, and Xiao Qiang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Qiang shared the following concern:

Client: Do you find yourself obsessing over lost items to the point where it distracts you from other tasks? Today, I discovered that my eye cream was missing, and I suddenly remembered that yesterday I helped my roommate throw away a large bag of stuff. Inside it was an eye cream identical to mine, which probably means that one was mine (because my roommate's bag was next to my cabinet and it could have fallen in there; at the time, I thought she didn't want it). It was almost new, probably only used for a week since I bought it. Although it's not particularly valuable, losing it makes me quite unhappy and frustrated. Then I recalled that my comb also mysteriously disappeared before, and it might have fallen into that bag too, but the bag is already gone. I know my stuff won't come back, and that thinking about it is pointless, yet I can't help but dwell on it. How can I rid myself of this emotion?

Dr. Chen: Accidentally losing something useful can definitely be upsetting, so ask yourself, when you're feeling upset, what is your inner voice saying? Could it be self-reproach: You clearly saw it; if you had looked again, this wouldn't have happened; you're really incompetent, this isn't the first time you've lost something; now you have to spend money to replace it, which really hurts... These are just examples I'm giving and may not reflect your inner voice, so try to quiet down and listen to what your inner voice is saying. It's these voices that make you dwell on the situation and feel upset repeatedly. Once we identify these thoughts, we can try to redefine the event: 1) Fortunately, it's just a comb and an eye cream that were lost, not something more valuable. 2) Although losing something incurred a cost, it also serves as a reminder to place things more appropriately in the future—this is a learned experience, and this experience is worth far more than the value of a comb and an eye cream. 3) The loss of the eye cream increases your awareness, which is curiosity! If similar situations arise in the future, curiosity might help you prevent the loss. These are still just examples, and you can find more personally valuable meanings in this incident, providing an opportunity to replace the discomfort of loss. Would you like to give it a try?

Dr. Zhang is a professional counselor, and Xiao Fang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Fang shared the following concern:

Client: How to firmly refuse pornographic products? In my youth, I was naive, lost in the online world, overwhelmed by various temptations, neglecting other aspects of life, and trapped in a sticky daily state, difficult to extricate myself. It also hindered my mother's freedom and drained my parents' finances, turning me into a recluse. When my mother was at work, the internet was my only companion. Days slipped by, and my health deteriorated. One day, I woke from a dream with stomach cramps and uncontrollable vomiting, yet I didn't go to the hospital. Looking back, I borrow a phrase: I was truly “afraid of living yet afraid of dying," living aimlessly, with suicide seeming like the only drive. One rainy night, I awoke and went out, attempting to find a place to bury my shameful self. After wandering in the cold, I returned home. I eventually found a job and began living under the structure of company life. Still, I occasionally face such dilemmas—lying in bed reading online novels from night until dawn, impulsively seeking release, my eyes swollen with tears, my head heavy with pain, continually provoking myself. Even if the next day I act as if nothing happened, just taking a shower, making a token act of repentance, and living a few relatively quiet days, the scars remain. Like a beggar covered in filth, hopelessly extending a hand for others' charity, my soul bears a noticeable stain, prompting regretful donations.

Dr. Zhang: Based on your description, this appears to be an addictive behavior that fulfills many of your psychological or emotional needs. Stern refusal is actually rational control and suppression. Emotional needs constitute a form of psychological energy, similar to how energy is conserved in the physical world. Suppression doesn't make this energy disappear; it only accumulates more, and when it explodes, its destructive power is greater. Therefore, the solution is substitution and compensation. For example, we cry when sad, destroy things when angry, and share with others when happy. If all your emotions are expressed only through pornography, and this method is overused, it's harmful. So, you need to correctly perceive your emotions and express them in appropriate ways, rather than using a single harmful method to express them. The inability to correctly perceive and express emotions might be related to early development experiences, such as parents not accepting their children's negative emotions, not allowing them to be their true selves, or lacking empathy. If you can't correctly perceive and express emotions, it's recommended to resolve this through counseling, to address the underlying subconscious reasons, allowing behavior to change.

Dr. Xu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Mei is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Mei shared the following concern:

Client: What should I do? Is it impossible for us now? I've been married to my husband for over a year, and we've always been arguing. Both of us go into a cold war mode. Every time after a fight, he's the one who apologizes to me. This time he said he wouldn't apologize anymore. When I approached him, his attitude was very indifferent. We made up for a few days and then argued again. I left and said we should live our own separate lives from now on. After some time, we met again because of issues related to our child. One day he asked me if I still had feelings for him, if I ever thought about him. He said he had thought about me but mentioned that ever since I left last time, it was impossible for us. He said he'd given up on me. I begged him, but he remained indifferent. I saw him chatting with another woman. A few days later, I decided to let it go. After a few days, he added me back and tried to win me over. I softened, but when I saw him chatting with that woman again, I asked him to delete her. He said he'd do it when he came home in the afternoon. I couldn't let it go and didn't want to be with him. After a long conversation, I said we shouldn't be together anymore. In the end, he said it was up to me. I regretted it and went to plead with him again, but he said we wouldn't be together anymore and blocked all my contacts. Can anyone tell me what I should do?

Dr. Xu: Please don't constantly say things like "we can't be together." You might just say it casually, and the other person might listen casually once or twice, but over time, the feeling changes. I believe that when two people have been together for a long time, they should learn to find a way of getting along that suits them both. You can reflect on past events, and if the previous approach doesn't work, try a different one. If your partner is always the one apologizing, you can learn to apologize too, or take the initiative to talk to them. Don't waste time on silent treatment. When arguments arise, learn to identify the points of contention, and talk about them once your emotions have settled. In a relationship, you don't always have to wait for your partner to apologize; you can be proactive because the two of you are going through life together, and debates over who is right don't have much value. For instance, if there's a fight, you can prepare a nice meal to satisfy your appetites and ease the tension. No matter the arguments, the end result is still the need to live life, but don't push your partner away.

Dr. Liu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Fang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Fang shared the following concern:

Client: What should I do when I can't help but raise my voice when asking about my child's studies? Last night, I asked my child some detailed questions, and she was unwilling to think them through. I ended up shouting uncontrollably. At 10:30 PM, my upstairs neighbor texted me, asking me to control my emotions as it was disturbing their rest. I do want to control myself, but at night, I get more worked up and feel compelled to correct her problems. My child’s biggest issue is that she never wants to diligently build her foundational skills, like doing math calculations, memorizing English vocabulary, and reviewing knowledge points in other subjects thoroughly. She only pays attention and ultimately masters the material after repeated nagging, yet by then, it's late at night, inevitably affecting her energy for the next day. However, superficial learning is the most harmful—it wastes time without effective results. Because of these issues, my child has wasted too much time, and her studies are regressing. How can I truly get her to study diligently? She understands the reasoning.

Dr. Liu: Hello, I'd like to send you a warm hug! Regarding the issue: Last night, when asking your child some detailed questions, your child was unwilling to think, causing you to lose control of your emotions and shout loudly at 10:30 PM, which disturbed the neighbors. The child's problem: The biggest issue is the child's reluctance to diligently work on the basics, like math calculations, memorizing English vocabulary, and properly reviewing knowledge points from other subjects. The approach taken: shouting. Only after repeated shouting does your child start to pay attention and eventually grasp it.

Your understanding: Superficial learning is the most harmful. It wastes time and shows no results, and your child has already wasted too much time, leading to regression in learning. Your request: How can you truly get her to study diligently? I see a few areas where we need to "give it some thought" together.

1. Shouting is effective. "Only after repeated shouting does it get attention and is finally mastered." So, the main approach you've been taking is shouting loudly and being unable to control yourself. At these times, our brains send out a command that it's time to shout, or else the child won't listen.

2. After shouting, it's said that she finally mastered it, but it's superficial learning, wasting time, and leading to regression.

3. So, analyzing points 1 and 2, you can redefine the effectiveness of "shouting." Many parents face children who are reluctant to think and refuse to study diligently, resulting in superficial learning after investing so much time and effort, but only regressing. It can make one lose control. However, we need to think about what really causes us to lose control in these situations. Why does it happen when facing our child? Is there a better method? Is the "effectiveness" after shouting really effective? Perhaps this is where we need improvement. We need to "give it some thought" and then reorganize our emotions, have a chat with the child, and see if there are difficulties in the learning process, or if the learning methods need improvement. There’s a book, "The Copyable Leadership," that has some great communication methods!

Finally, sending you a gentle hug! I hope everything turns out well!

Dr. Chen is a professional counselor, and Xiao Na is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Na shared the following concern:

Client: No matter what I do, I lack confidence, and it's greatly affecting me, to the point where I even lack confidence when walking. I have a problem. I am not confident in anything I do and I like to compare myself to others. No matter who it is, I want to compare myself to them, yet I always feel I can't measure up to anyone. This mindset has run through me, affecting my three years of high school studies greatly. I felt really awful. Now, even in college, it's still like this. I can't stop thinking about how I can't compare, I have no energy to study, and I lack confidence even when walking. It's really painful. I feel like I'm the worst person in the world, without exception. I'm seeking help.

Dr. Chen: Hello, dear questioner. You might not want to compare yourself with others, but can't help doing so, and you're aware that these comparisons have led to your lack of confidence. So, should we stop comparing? Not necessarily. If you can't stop, then go ahead and continue to compare. However, we can change the angle of comparison. Dear, have you noticed that you often compare your weaknesses to others' strengths? Now try comparing your strengths to others' weaknesses. After all, if you must compare, what difference does the angle make? This way of comparing can greatly improve your mood and boost your confidence. You might wonder if this type of comparison is self-deception, focusing only on your strengths while ignoring your shortcomings. Can you still improve this way? In fact, the key now is whether you have confidence. Once your confidence increases, you might naturally compare less, because at that point, you'll have more things you want to do with your time, reducing the time spent comparing yourself to others. Embrace your tendency to compare, gain some confidence gradually, and believe in your own potential. This is just for your reference. May we both live the lives we desire... Wishing you: as I watch you, you become better and better!

Dr. Wu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Lan is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Lan shared the following concern:

Client: Every time I'm with my partner, there's nothing much to talk about? Whenever I'm with my partner, neither of us seems to have anything to say—he doesn't have much he wants to tell me, and I don't have much I want to tell him. I'm also not someone who likes to chatter away. What should I do?

Dr. Wu: Hello! Your question is very representative, and I think many people have the same concerns as you. Here is my response, for your reference only:

1. Many people feel anxious about being silent, always thinking they need to say something. But in both interpersonal and intimate relationships, we tend to fear "chatterboxes." We don't need to fill the time with words; instead, we should speak naturally at the right moments. This approach not only avoids awkwardness but also takes away pressure—just let things be.

2. Your anxiety might fundamentally stem from a fear of a monotonous, emotionless state in your marital relationship where there is a loss of emotional connection. For partners who don't have much to say to each other, consider whether both are simply not talkative. If neither of you likes to talk, don't force a conversation; instead, watch TV together or find activities that both of you are interested in doing. Silence isn't frightening, but a life with no content that makes both of you uncomfortable and disconnected is. You might ask if watching TV together creates a sense of connection. Actually, choosing content that either of you likes to watch, being there for each other, cuddling, or chatting about interesting points from the show can all strengthen the sense of connection and give a feeling of home. If you're young and dislike quiet activities like these, you can try exploring recipes and cooking new dishes together, go shopping, or prepare for weekend outings. 

Life must have content, and enriching it is necessary. You need to explore together how to add content to your lives. Developing common interests and hobbies is essential for increasing the closeness of your relationship. For instance, you could play badminton, sing karaoke, work out together, etc.—choose what suits you both.

3. Consider whether your partner used to be talkative but has gradually become less inclined to speak within your relationship. If this is the case, it’s important to consider clarifying and addressing the issues in your relationship: What has made your partner reluctant to talk to you? What has caused your interactions to grow more distant? When couples are together for a long time, issues are bound to surface at some point. You need to address these issues in the future and enhance the quality of your marital relationship.

Best wishes to you both!

Dr. Zhao is a professional counselor, and Xiao Fang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Fang shared the following concern:

Client: In a friendship among three people, am I the one being left out? I have a good friend. We used to be very happy; she told me we're good friends, and I believed her. Then one day, she made a new friend, and they were very happy together. I also played with them, but I realized I don't quite fit in. It's because I can't bring happiness to others the way she can. That's when I discovered that the idea of a 'good friend' isn't as great as I thought it would be.

Dr. Zhao: Perhaps you haven't been abandoned; you just long for more and hope to receive the other person's attention. When she has another friend appear, the time she spends on you might be less than before. However, it's impossible for people to always maintain relationships with the same individuals. At different stages, one will encounter different partners, colleagues, and so on. You must allow others to have their own friends, just as you will in the future. You can also happily make friends like she does, provided you can make yourself happy. Only by being happy yourself can you attract more friends. Giving leads to receiving. If you wait for others to bring you happiness, remember that there is always a certain value exchange between friends.

Dr. Xu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Hong is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Hong shared the following concern:

Client: Why is my first reaction to attacks and harm to pretend as if nothing happened? Recently, I've noticed that I don't know why, but when I encounter sudden verbal attacks or conflicts from the outside, or any unexpected situations, my first response when I feel uncomfortable or unsafe is to act as if nothing happened, rather than feeling angry and retaliating. Afterwards, I regret avoiding it and not protecting myself, wondering why I lack the courage... (Female college student)

Dr. Xu: When you have such awareness, I think it's great. The next step is to consider whether you want to make adjustments. It’s possible that internally you're afraid of conflict or unexpected situations. Many people feel they have no temperament, that they don't get angry, but it may be similar to your situation; it's not that they lack temperament, but their emotions are suppressed due to internal fears. This could be related to your childhood experiences, such as whether elders taught you that conflict is bad, that having a good temper, being tolerant, and being kind to others are good qualities... things like that. If we grew up with such education, our subconscious might avoid conflict, and in order to avoid the feeling of being hurt by conflict, we isolate our emotions, resulting in what you describe as a lack of feeling. But this isn’t truly a lack of feeling because you felt uncomfortable afterwards. If you want to change the current situation, you can try learning to express yourself, such as writing a mood diary, practicing mindful meditation, returning to the moments of events, and trying to feel what the real emotions behind the lack of feeling are. If similar events happen again, what can you do? Perhaps when you become aware of things, it will be beneficial for you to make subsequent adjustments. Also, try practicing with relationships that are closer to you.

Dr. Zhao is a professional counselor, and Xiao Na is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Na shared the following concern:

Client: I'm filled with regret. My friends tell me not to overthink, but what should I do? Maybe I'm too bothersome, so they think I might not be able to accomplish certain things, which leads to my regret. Then I want to check in with them, have my mom help relieve some of my worries, but instead they just tell me not to overthink, to relax, to be happy. What should I do?

Dr. Zhao: I feel like many things are on a particular level, and when you can't reach that level, you need to learn to bring yourself up to it. You may feel like you're too bothered, which might lead others to think you can't accomplish certain things. This is your feeling, and I believe these feelings are quite real. Have you thought about how to do the things you want to do? Do you have any plans? It’s important to have a direction for what you want in your heart, rather than spending too much time asking others. You can also gather methods on your own. Asking too many questions about doing something can give the impression that you lack confidence, direction, or a specific plan. A person with a concrete direction might spend more time figuring out how to proceed rather than asking too much—though, of course, it's necessary to ask at times. For what you want to do, try not to rely too much on others; you can encourage yourself and learn to try things bit by bit on your own. When they tell you not to overthink, it's perhaps because you're concerned about certain things while doing them. Why do you think people around you respond this way? The reason might be that you're overthinking and have concerns, maybe wanting to act but being afraid, or wanting to act without direction or specific methods. They don't tell you because they worry and don't want you to have too many concerns, but this in turn affects your ability to do what you want to do. So, you should work on strengthening yourself and trying things on your own.

Dr. Li is a professional counselor, and Xiao Qiang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Qiang shared the following concern:

Client: At 22, I overthink things when interacting with girls, which makes me timid? I'm a 22-year-old man with no experience in relationships, yet my family has arranged multiple blind dates for me. I've read about many romantic experiences and always hope to better myself before meeting someone I like. I'm constantly worried about whether I can offer a better life to a partner at this stage, which is making me very afraid right now. When interacting with girls, I find myself thinking about all sorts of issues.

Dr. Li: # 22 years old, male, with no experience in dating, yet repeatedly set up for blind dates by family, # this is common in many parts of China. In your area, people your age are all going on blind dates, right? It's the same for both men and women, isn't it? So perhaps it would be better to focus on the present for now? What if you miss out on a good girl because you're not paying attention? # You've read many dating stories, always hoping to become a better person before meeting someone you like and working hard for it. You're also worried about whether you can provide a better life for your partner at this stage. # It's normal to have expectations and worries at this stage. You haven't experienced or gone through it, so you can only rely on imagination to handle the "blind date" situation right now, which is very normal. Many people have gone through this as well. But consider gathering feedback from your interactions with girls before making further decisions? # As a result, you are now very fearful of it, constantly thinking about various issues when interacting with girls. # There's nothing wrong with thinking about various questions when interacting with girls! But can you still observe the other person well? Can the other person interact and chat with you comfortably? When interacting with girls, first gather information properly, then go home and think about the issues? Or maybe share with friends or parents for their insights? Would speeding up the process of sorting out your issues help? Would this approach be better? If you need to talk, you can leave a message or send a private message.

Dr. Zhang is a professional counselor, and Xiao Na is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Na shared the following concern:

Client: When the leader criticizes others, I feel anxious. Why do I always have a sense of fear and apprehension inside? When the leader criticizes someone else, I get a strange sense of nervousness and anxiety, and I'm not sure why. It's very confusing.

Dr. Zhang: When a leader criticizes others, you feel nervous and anxious. At this time, you might think about what issues are on your mind, and you can carefully reflect on them. How do you evaluate your abilities and your work? I guess if a person's abilities don't match their current job, then feeling anxious is normal, and being afraid is also normal, because problems can arise at any time, and when they do, you have to solve them. Thinking about whether you can solve these problems is key. Therefore, first improve your own abilities and understand some processes for handling matters. When you have some understanding, you naturally won't be as afraid. Also, the final results of doing certain things don't need overly much affirmation from others, and you shouldn't anticipate too much praise or criticism from others. Try to accept moments when criticism or praise may occur. Additionally, learn to take responsibility for your actions.

Dr. Wu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Mei is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Mei shared the following concern:

Client: I feel very insecure and think I'm not good enough. I always feel like I've let my parents down. What should I do? Before I turned 15, I started working to support my family. I really wanted to go to school; I was an average student and even the English class representative. I was also good at drawing. But due to our poor family conditions, I couldn't bear to see my parents suffer more, so I took the initiative to work and earn money. I hoped to make money for a year or two and then return home to attend a vocational school. For six years, all my wages were sent to my mom. It wasn't until my fifth year of working that my parents suggested I learn some computer skills at a training center. When I got married, my parents didn't come because it was far away. They didn't come when I had my first child, nor my second, but they often made me buy things for my family home. Even when they occasionally treated me well or made a phone call, they would ask me to buy things for them. I feel very insecure and believe that my parents treat me this way because I'm not good enough. I'm insecure in front of my husband too, and it makes me very sad. I wonder if someone like me can raise children properly.

Dr. Wu: Hello, after reading your story, I also feel a sense of similarity with you. In your original family, as a child, you sacrificed a lot, giving up your education just to make your parents' lives a bit easier. These are areas where you have excelled. However, you currently feel that your parents didn't give you enough love, perhaps because you felt you weren't good enough, and this has become a deep thorn in your heart. You are worried that some of your attitudes might affect your child's education. How should we view this situation? [The personality and behavior of parents do affect the psychological growth and development of children.] Your concern is indeed valid, and the fact that you are aware of this and are trying to make changes is commendable. It's important to understand that your personality and behavior patterns were formed in your original family, and you can't change that. However, through your own learning and growth, you can gradually improve and elevate yourself. Because of your awareness and discoveries, you can minimize the impact of your traits like low self-esteem on your child's psychological development. Around me, there are also mothers who have experienced their own traumas and real-life challenges, who, through continuous learning and growth, understand what might negatively impact children and know how to minimize mistakes in educational methods. With their efforts, their children have also grown up well, often better than those with negative education without self-growth. [Grow and progress together with your child.] As mentioned above, parenthood is not something everyone can automatically excel at. Without learning, even a confident parent might inadvertently have some negative impact on their child's education. Therefore, techniques and methods can be learned. I recommend checking out books like "Parents Are the Best Toys for Children" and "Positive Discipline," which emphasize cultivating children's emotional expression, interpersonal skills, and sex education. At the same time, as you learn how to educate your child, you will also find healing and growth yourself. As a counselor friend of mine says, "A wise mother will take the growth process of educating and accompanying her child as a means of self-healing, while an unwise mother will pass on all her problems to her child." Therefore, by diligently focusing on your child's education, your issues with self-esteem can greatly improve, and your inner self will also experience growth.

Dr. Zhou is a professional counselor, and Xiao Hong is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Hong shared the following concern:

Client: Why does seeing someone I dislike seriously affect my mood? Watching her do anything impacts my emotions. For example, when she takes a shower, I feel like she's using my electricity. When she uses the bathroom, I feel like she's using the facilities I've provided as if it's her right. Anything related to me, I just can't stand it.

Dr. Zhou: This indicates that this person has a relatively close relationship with you on a practical level, but you do not crave such a close relationship with her, and it seems quite difficult to detach from it, which is why you find her more unbearable. Actually, the deeper reason is that you have expectations of her, but she hasn't been able to meet those expectations. Your various discontent with her is truly your own self-criticism and non-acceptance because being overly critical of oneself is too painful and no one wants to admit their incompetence or unlovability, so these feelings are projected onto her. There's a saying in psychology: non-acceptance, criticism, and harshness toward others are actually non-acceptance, criticism, and harshness toward oneself. The amount of dissatisfaction you hold toward others reflects the dissatisfaction you hold toward yourself. You might want to reflect and observe whether this is the case.

Client: I'm 28, currently dealing with severe depression and moderate anxiety. What should I do? Because of issues in my relationship, I don't know what to do. I feel that I'm not wrong. If you can't keep a promise, why agree to it in the first place? Now he's avoiding me; he doesn't initiate contact, though he does reply when I text him. When I ask him about it, he says he doesn't want to move forward, just wants to keep things as they are, which makes me very uncomfortable. How do I resolve this? I don't know if I can't let go of this person or if I'm just unwilling to accept it.

Dr. Sun: Hello, poster: It sounds like the setbacks in your relationship have triggered your anxiety, causing you a lot of pain, right? I'm curious about how you've determined that you have depression and anxiety. Was it diagnosed by an authoritative institution, or did you reach this conclusion on your own by looking up symptoms online? I'm not sure what specific promises your boyfriend broke. From your brief description, it seems that your boyfriend promised you something and didn't follow through, choosing instead to avoid the issue, which hurt you a lot. Could the interaction pattern between the two of you be related to your current anxiety and depression? It's commendable that you've sought help on this platform, but counseling takes time and requires detailed information. Could you provide more details?

Dr. Zhang is a professional counselor, and Xiao Mei is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Mei shared the following concern:

Client: A 16-year-old first-year high school boy has been unable to concentrate on his studies for the past year, feeling overwhelmed and just wanting to escape. He feels dazed every day. Previously an excellent student, he stopped studying abruptly in the second semester of 9th grade when the pandemic hit, while others were studying hard to prepare for exams. He became obsessed with playing video games and wouldn't even glance at a book. He has broken down a few times, crying over his inability to study and worrying about his future, but still, he doesn't open a book and is deeply avoidant. Eventually, he took an art school entrance exam without preparation and got in. After starting school, his natural talent for art and strong academic foundation led him to rank first in his class. He developed a crush on a girl who is also smart, tall, and beautiful, but was rejected when he confessed his feelings. Since then, he's been in a slump, repeatedly questioning why he is so short and unattractive. Though his family and friends insist he's not bad-looking and girls often add him on WeChat, he can't see anything good in himself. He stays up late every night, and when he struggled with an art subject, he fell apart, starting to despise life and feeling worthless. He can’t focus in class, and his grades have deteriorated drastically. In the past month, he lost nearly three thousand yuan worth of belongings, including his glasses, down jacket, hoodie, wireless Bluetooth earphones, and school uniform, all inexplicably vanished as if he’s lost his memory. He dreads going to school every day, feeling that it's meaningless.

Dr. Zhang: Hello, OP! I read your description, and it's very clear and straightforward. I tried to feel what you're experiencing and it made my heart ache, while also feeling a tightness in my chest, sensing a kind of despair! Let's take a look at your issues: 

1. You used to excel in your studies, but during the second semester of your third year, due to the pandemic, you suddenly stopped studying and couldn't engage with your work. It's not that you didn't want to; you just couldn't control it.

2. You're going through each day in a daze, addicted to video games, which you don't want, and your grades are gradually declining, leading to breakdowns and crying.

3. After being rejected when you confessed your feelings, you felt terrible about yourself, thinking you're worthless, and you lost interest in attending school, feeling there's no purpose.

4. In the past month, you've lost nearly three thousand yuan worth of items, including glasses, a down jacket, a hoodie, wireless Bluetooth earbuds, and your school uniform, with no recollection of where they went, as if you lost your memory.

Child, these points all indicate one direction: you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. Perhaps many people around you, including your parents and teachers, cannot understand, and may think you're not strong or hardworking enough. You might also feel bad about yourself. But this is not the truth. You're uncomfortable, and this discomfort cannot be overcome by your willpower alone, and it might even cause you more pain.

For your mental and physical health, and to ensure you have a better future, I have a few suggestions: The primary suggestion is to seek help and find a professional counselor for systematic psychological therapy. Secondly, if things become unbearably difficult to control, see a local psychiatrist for a diagnosis and follow their advice on medication. Thirdly, make an effort to get outside, don't stay at home, engage in more social interactions, exercise, and spend more time in nature.

Dr. Wu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Fang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Fang shared the following concern:

Client: I always feel particularly upset whenever it comes to reunions like the Spring Festival or Mid-Autumn Festival, not wanting to go home. I'm 24, worked for three years, and this year I'm preparing for graduate school. I have a boyfriend I've been with for four years (he's preparing for his Ph.D. and has no plans to marry me). I was a left-behind child. My dad left to work away from home when I was in the second year of high school and returned to Kunming during my junior year in college to divorce my mom. Both accused the other of infidelity, but I'm not sure who was telling the truth because I didn't spend much time with them and don't know either well. 

The day before the Spring Festival in 2017, after a fight with my mom (because she came back one evening, I asked what she wanted to eat, bought some groceries, and cooked, but she started verbally abusing and insulting me. Unable to bear it, I left for school), I haven't returned to Kunming for any New Year or other holidays. I might have gone back twice, but neither visit was pleasant. From what I remember, my time with her was always filled with her scolding, leading me to dread going back to Kunming now. It makes me cry inexplicably and feel absent-minded. Mainly, I feel there's no home for me there. My family was poor, and I grew up with my grandmother. Now she's old and living with my uncle (who had an affair), so I don't want to go to her. My dad has no house, and when I think of my mom, all I can picture are her insults. What should I do?

Dr. Wu: Hello, OP! I see your concern is that you feel especially uncomfortable during festivals like Spring Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival, and don't want to go home? A Tang Dynasty poet, Wang Wei, wrote: "Alone in a foreign land as a lonely stranger, every festive season doubly missing my dear ones." The meaning expressed here roughly conveys that there's no sense of belonging in a foreign land, and during these traditional Chinese festivals when families reunite, you're unable to be with them, hence feeling particularly lonely. I believe you feel the same way. During these two nationwide family reunion festivals, Mid-Autumn and Spring Festival, your longing for family and home naturally arises, but because your family cannot offer you warmth and love, you don't want to return to them. This unfulfilled need for love and belonging causes you to feel desolate, lonely, and uncomfortable, doesn't it? Reading your description, I deeply sigh over your experiences and situation. Now, let's explore together what you can do.

1. Event Feelings
   - You are a 24-year-old woman, having worked for three years and now preparing for graduate exams.
   - You have a boyfriend of four years who is preparing for a Ph.D. and doesn’t plan to marry you.
   - You grew up as a left-behind child; your family was not well-off, and you were raised by your grandmother.
   - Your father went out to work when you were in the second year of high school and returned in your junior year of university, divorcing your mother due to mutual accusations of infidelity.
   - The day before Spring Festival in 2017, you kindly cooked for your mother, but she scolded you, so you returned to school, unable to bear it.
   - Since then, you rarely return home for festivals; the only two times you did, you were scolded by your mother, making the thought of going home unbearable.
   - The grandmother who raised you now lives with your unfaithful uncle, your father has no house, and you don't want to return to them.

2. Problem Analysis
   - At 24, preparing for a graduate exam after working for three years shows you have clear goals for personal development. You're ambitious and hardworking; I commend your fighting spirit and courage to live life!
   - Your boyfriend is also quite ambitious and cares about his career and future. Is his plan not to marry you just short-term while pursuing his Ph.D., or does he never intend to marry you?
   - As a left-behind child, your longing for love and lack of it leads to a lack of belonging, feeling helpless and unsupported.
   - Your father and mother’s divorce and mutual blame may make you feel even more incomplete and unfulfilled.
   - You cooked for your mother hoping to gain her love, yet she returned your kindness with insults. How deeply hurt your already fragile heart must be. Returning alone to school on such a lively holiday, I can imagine your isolation and collapse.
   - Enduring so much pain with no warmth or care from family or partner, you cover your inner pain and needs with work and study on normal days. However, once you slow down, especially when thinking of harmonious family scenes, your grievances and pain become uncontrollable—you're not crying for no reason; your emotions are calling out.
   - Your mother's scolding, your father's lack of a home, and your grandmother living with your uncle leaves you nowhere to go. So, where should you head?

3. Suggested Methods
   - I believe you can satisfy your external life needs through your own efforts. However, your mental life is seriously lacking, even very problematic. The hurt from your mother seems largest; on one hand, you avoid harm by distancing yourself, but on the other, consider why she insults you—perhaps she's venting her inner pain onto you. Although it's intolerable for you, understanding her pain might make you feel a little better.
   - You mentioned your parents blame each other for infidelity and your uncle too shows infidelity issues—there seem to be problems with intimate relationships in your family. Infidelity usually occurs when emotional needs within the marriage aren't met. Identifying family members' psychological issues is complex, but you might reflect if, unconsciously, your relationship with your boyfriend is replicating this pattern.
   - If your boyfriend can't marry you in the short term, it's understandable. But if he never plans to marry you, consider if you can accept that. If you have marriage needs, after getting a clear answer from your boyfriend, make other plans.
   - During holidays, everyone away from home wants to reunite with family and gain warmth. When unable to gather, emotions certainly arise, but those with good family emotional relations who have received love and a sense of belonging feel less lonely. Without family support and acceptance, first heal your heart, enrich it. Seek professional psychological help for this, or engage in self-growth, recognize emotions, accept emotions, change perceptions, release emotions, and rewrite subconscious memories.
   - Some injuries have already formed, some memories are indelible. In childhood, you were helpless and passive, but growing up means gaining the power to turn passive into active. For instance, after understanding your mother, communicate with her. Tell her you know she's in pain and life is hard, but as her daughter, hearing her scold you rips your heart apart, and you hope for kinder treatment. Also, show more concern for her inner feelings, help release her inner bitterness.
   - Though your father doesn’t have a home, you can still strengthen contact. Living with your uncle doesn't prevent you from being close to your grandmother. Where does your boyfriend go for the New Year—could you be with him? Emotional isolation first comes from ourselves. Although created by injury and hard to let go all at once, time changes family hearts too. You must adjust your mindset, see relationships with a dynamic view, and approach, understand them to meet your love and belonging needs.

I hope this response helps you. Best wishes!

Dr. Zhang is a professional counselor, and Xiao Ming is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Ming shared the following concern:

Client: What should be done if the left-behind children next door are bullied at school? The left-behind children next door are being bullied by classmates. Their parents are away working and not at home, and they are afraid to tell the teachers because they fear it will make the bullies worse. What should they do?

Dr. Zhang: Left-behind children already lack the love and care of their parents, and when they are also subjected to bullying at school, their situation is truly tragic and pitiable. The child will have many feelings of sadness, helplessness, grievance, and heartbreak. Therefore, if possible, there should first be someone who allows the child to express these inner feelings through tears. This person needs to be someone who can see the child's various difficulties and understand their inner feelings, so they can handle the child's emotions. This process itself can give the child strength. Once the child has gained some inner strength, it is best, with the help of others, to find ways to respond to bullying in a manner that follows rules. Of course, this is not easy and may require the child to consciously build courage and strength, gradually turning defeat into victory. Generally speaking, classmates who bully often are themselves bullied by others, which is why they use similar methods to hide their own powerlessness. In other words, the bullies are not so strong and have their own vulnerabilities. Knowing this might also help the left-behind child. But in any case, being a left-behind child means enduring many hardships, and they have to find ways to face these challenges on their own and turn their suffering into resources, skills, and life meaning. This seems to apply not just to left-behind children, but to everyone. Best wishes, Wang Chunguang from Zhurong Psychology.

Dr. Chen is a professional counselor, and Xiao Jun is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Jun shared the following concern:

Client: Are you overly concerned about what others think and tend to overthink before doing things? I'm a 20-year-old junior in college, and I feel like I place too much importance on others' opinions. I'm always trying to make a good impression on everyone, so I tend to overthink before doing anything. I often imagine how I would perceive someone if they acted in a particular way, and if there’s even a slight chance it might seem negative, I choose not to act, possibly because I'm afraid of leaving a bad impression on others.

For example, when competing for important positions, I can clearly see that the candidates are very goal-driven or even opportunistic, which I find off-putting. I'm afraid others will see me the same way if I act like that, so I shy away. At the same time, I'm also afraid of failing in front of others, so I adopt a mindset that if I don't try, I won't fail.

This attitude is also present in my interactions with others. I'm wary of approaching people with an ulterior motive, so I'm not very proactive and tend to overthink things. My girlfriend says I sometimes act like a girl, indecisive and overthinking everything. I'm beginning to see that she might be right, and I really want to change my personality to become more outgoing, straightforward, and decisive.

Dr. Chen: Hello! I understand your feelings. During our growth, many of us go through a phase where we are quite concerned with other people's opinions. We all long for approval and often care about how others perceive us, though the degree of concern varies. You feel you're overly concerned right now, thinking too much. I'd like to share my understanding with you, hoping it will help. 

1. Understand and accept yourself, and you won't be overly focused on others. Have you considered the deeper reasons for wanting to leave a good impression on others? Is it to gain positive feedback or to make more friends? No one in the world is perfect. When we try to appear perfect without truly being so, we become hesitant and afraid to try. Being too concerned with others makes us lose our freedom. How can we improve this? When we have a strong understanding of ourselves and are clear about who we are without altering our self-perception based on others' opinions, our emotions and personality will stabilize. When our inner self is very fragile, we tend to overthink, fearing that others dislike us or that we will fail. We can continually encourage ourselves internally, assuring that we are already whole without relying on external validation. At the same time, we should allow ourselves to have shortcomings, recognize them, and be willing to improve. Realizing that you are overly focused on others is already the first step towards change.

2. Change your perception of failure and hesitation to try new things. I wonder if you've heard that life is an experience. From this perspective, everything is just an experience, whether success or failure. It only adds to your experiences, helping you grow. Imagine a person trying to avoid doing anything to prevent failure—would you want that kind of life? You surely know that failure is the mother of success. Who succeeds in everything they do? No one. There's something else I'd like to share: no one is paying as much attention to you as your family and friends do. Everyone is very busy, and no matter how big your failures or successes, others won't remember them forever. "There is no one outside, only yourself." So be brave to do what you want, regardless of what others think, as long as you understand your own thoughts.

3. Take it slow, practice step by step. Although we understand many principles, if we don't act on them, they have no real significance. Start from the smallest, simplest things to gradually build confidence. For small matters, consider that even if you fail, it's not a big deal—just go for it. "Thinking is always the problem; doing is the answer." Remind yourself that perfection doesn't exist, and there are no perfect people. Dare to take responsibility, and you will find the courage to make decisions. Trying more will definitely make you more decisive. Keeping a success diary is a good method. Whenever you make a decisive move, note it down, or write down any achievements you've made during your growth. Whenever you fear failure or hesitate, take a look at it. For the things done poorly, remind yourself that it's okay not to be perfect yet, as long as you maintain a mindset of constant growth, you'll surely be better than you were yesterday. Wishing you to overcome your troubles soon, all the best!

Dr. Zhou is a professional counselor, and Xiao Fang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Fang shared the following concern:

Client: What should I do if I have a very low sense of self-worth and a high level of defensiveness? I'm afraid of interacting with others, and when I do, I always put my own feelings last, which makes the process of socializing very exhausting. I need to be alone for a while to recharge. I realize that my self-value recognition is too low, but I don't know how to improve it. I don't trust anyone, and my defense mechanisms are very strong because I feel that I automatically switch to a mode of limitless people-pleasing. Every time I slightly show my emotions, like complaining or getting angry, I can't stop hating and blaming myself, which leads to self-depression. How can I like myself more and interact with others more comfortably?

Dr. Zhou: #Afraid of interacting with people, always putting my feelings last when I do. The process of socializing exhausts me, and I need to be alone for a while to recharge. I realize my sense of self-worth is too low, but I don't know how to improve it. I don't trust anyone, and my guard is always up.#

From your description, is it possible that in your environment, if you don't maintain your current coping mechanisms, you could easily get hurt? Are the people around you more dominant, have status, or are older? Is there no one willing to understand you? In such an environment, I think many would choose your way of coping because there might not be a better option at the moment.

#Because I feel like I automatically switch to a mode of endless people-pleasing.#

In the environment I've assumed, I understand why you feel the need to please others without boundaries. If there were better choices, I believe you would choose differently.

#Every time my emotions come out a little, like complaining or getting angry, I can't stop disliking and blaming myself, starting a spiral of self-deprecation. How can I like myself more and feel more at ease when interacting with others?#

Complaining, anger, self-loathing, and self-blame—all because "presently" you can't change the "predicament." But the situation isn't your fault or a sign of your incapability. You need to give yourself time to grow and gain strength. Many times, "change" requires a process and accumulation of power. If interacting with others in your environment takes so much energy, you can try to minimize contact to reduce exhaustion. Once you gather enough "strength," you could choose to experience a new environment, where people might feel different. Would you consider trying a new environment if possible? If you need to communicate, feel free to leave a message or private message.

Dr. Liu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Qiang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Qiang shared the following concern:

Client: I'm 30 years old and have been feeling very tired for the past year. Sometimes, I suddenly feel like crying. What could be causing this? I suffer from insomnia, and as soon as night falls, I start overthinking and can't control myself. My boyfriend and I are in a long-distance relationship, and we might be on the verge of breaking up. I feel very confused.

Dr. Liu: Hello, if you allow me, I'd like to give you a big hug first, hoping to offer you some warmth and support! I wonder if the feeling of exhaustion over the past year is related to the "relationship about to end" that you mentioned. If that's the case, it's truly something that could make one feel very "tired." For most people, a relationship is either "passionately fiery" or "tenderly affectionate," and both are enjoyable processes. If it's "constantly conflict-ridden" or "lukewarm," then it hardly offers enjoyment and only leaves exhaustion. If the "tiredness" is related to this relationship, perhaps it's worth calming down to sort things out and think about how you want to face this relationship in the future. Whether it means breaking up or continuing, it’s good to have a clear attitude and direction. If your "tiredness" has little to do with this relationship, then let's examine what other aspects of life are making you dissatisfied, see if there's potential for change, and how to make that change. Finding the root cause of your "tiredness" is key to addressing and solving the problems that lead to it. These are just my personal thoughts, for your reference only. Take good care of yourself.

Dr. Zhang is a professional counselor, and Xiao Mei is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Mei shared the following concern:

Client: I'm 26 years old, married, and have a bachelor's degree. What should I do if I don't like my current job and find it meaningless? The work pressure is intense, mainly psychological stress stemming from systemic issues in the railway project. I'm constantly away from home, living and working in the same office building. I graduated with a degree in accounting but switched departments after three years, from accounting to materials, and I still don't enjoy it. Moreover, I lack other skills to earn a living, and my husband works in the same unit. I often feel confused and envy my college classmates who became teachers, enjoying freedom and self-sufficiency. How should I cope with this work that feels both meaningless and overwhelming?

Dr. Zhang: You said that your current situation is "being away all year round, eating, drinking, and everything else happening in an office building", while you envy your college classmates who "became teachers, free and self-sufficient". Although I don't know your specific situations, conventionally speaking, your work and living environment seem extremely monotonous at the moment. I'm not sure if this is related to your job position because you didn't mention changing positions; I'm guessing this environment is the main reason you feel it's meaningless. Compared to your current job, teaching is indeed very free, especially if your classmate is in a school rather than a tutoring institution. The freedom mostly comes from the school environment, typically offering weekends off and winter and summer breaks, so it's normal to feel envious. Even if it's a tutoring institution, it might still be more freeing than your current job.

You mentioned "switching from accounting to materials, still not liking it, and lacking other income skills". I suspect it's not just the materials position; you probably didn't like the accounting position either. It's truly unfortunate because, from my perspective, what you aspire to may not be the teaching job itself, but rather a more vibrant life compared to your current job, which is the so-called freedom.

There's a saying when changing jobs: "Change the industry, not the position; change the position, not the industry". If your admired classmate is indeed in a school, then, if you wish to enter a school, it would mean changing industries, so try not to change your job role. With an undergraduate degree in accounting and experience working as one, you don't necessarily need other income skills to change your work environment and life rhythm. However, you might not like accounting either, which would be truly regrettable, as you have no other cards to play for changing your work environment. If you enter a school as an accountant, the job might still not appeal to you, but at least outside of work, you should have much more freedom than you do now; although, there might be exams involved. As for self-sufficiency, that would still depend on the situation.

If you're considering becoming a teacher in a school, it's not impossible; you could pursue a graduate degree. Many vocational schools in cities hire master's graduates as teachers, and you can pursue a master's in a field of your choice. However, the increasing number of graduate students means this path isn't as easy. From what I observe, making money from students is indeed easier, so generally, the living and entertainment facilities near a school are more complete. Choosing a job actually means choosing a lifestyle. You do have choices, but they come with trade-offs. For instance, if you don't change jobs, you won't have to endure the pain of exams and interviews but will need to bear the agony of your current work environment. So, it depends on how you make your trade-offs.

Dr. Liu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Qiang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Qiang shared the following concern:

Client: I don't have good relationships with anyone, there’s no emotional connection, and I feel like I'm not human. Nothing happened, yet it feels like something did. I have poor relationships with everyone, including my baby who’s only a few months old—I don’t know how to communicate. There’s no emotional exchange with my parents, and it's the same with friends and family. I don't know how to be grateful. I stayed at my uncle's house for six months, and now I rarely visit or show any thanks. My little cousin is over ten years old, and I don’t communicate with him either, let alone anyone else. At work, I don’t interact with colleagues. Even when I manage to have a conversation, it never goes well. Just a few words and it’s unpleasant. At home, I also talk little with my husband; seeing him makes me feel tired. Sometimes, I feel unmotivated and don’t read. I rarely talk to my in-laws, almost never. At work, a colleague who just graduated is my boss, even though they’re much younger than me and earn more. Our company is very basic. From school until now, I've been struggling with inner conflicts, enduring a long period of darkness. I thought I had overcome it, but later realized I might have slipped back in. Facing setbacks is discouraging; there are too many problems, and nothing is easy. I feel worthless and uneducated.

Dr. Liu: "#A Word for Those Feeling Down# Have you ever had the experience of attaching a memory to an object? For example, storing a beautiful memory onto a train ticket. By keeping this ticket, you can recall those days whenever you see it. You can also seal away bad memories in an object, like a small glass bottle—write down the event, put it in the bottle, and mark it with 'To be opened on November 25, 2029' with a permanent marker."

Dr. Wang is a professional counselor, and Xiao Fang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Fang shared the following concern:

Client: I was very reluctant to marry my current husband, how can I move past my resentment? I was very unwilling and dissatisfied when I married my current husband. Although he tolerates everything about me, I still feel very unsatisfied. He's not capable and is short in stature, unable to provide me with support. All these years, I still cannot get used to him.

Dr. Wang: Hello, OP. You seem dissatisfied with your current marriage, often feeling resentful, even though you have been together for so many years. You still feel unhappy with your partner. When you married him initially, there was some reluctance. Do you remember why you chose him back then? Perhaps you can reflect on your original intentions and the reasons for choosing him. I want to say that since you chose him, there must have been something about him that attracted you, something that made you decide to be with him despite knowing his many flaws and your dissatisfaction. However, as your time together lengthens, it's unclear if what once attracted you to him still exists. Now, it seems like all you feel is reluctance in this marriage and dissatisfaction with him. Maybe you could focus more on his positive qualities. Sometimes, we concentrate so much on what we lack that we overlook what we already have. Think from another perspective: if we had chosen someone else initially, would we really be better off now? Marriage also needs nurturing. Consider what you can do to improve your current situation and what changes you might make. If there truly is no way to change, then perhaps consider whether this marriage is still necessary. Best wishes~.

Dr. Liu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Wei is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Wei shared the following concern:

Client: Being told by minors that I'm the one who's immature, what should I do? The incident happened in a small supermarket, where there were two disabled teenagers (mentally normal) who were smoking in the non-smoking supermarket. They come almost every day, each time smoking there, refusing to listen when told otherwise, deliberately provoking me. What's even worse is they smoke when there are lots of people around, making me afraid to say anything to them. Finally, today, I reached my limit and told them to go outside, to come back after they finished smoking. However, they completely ignored me and became even more blatant, spitting on the floor. I was furious at the time, but I maintained a calm tone without snapping at them. In frustration, I just let it go, despite the whole place smelling like smoke. There's nothing I could do; after all, it's pitiful for them. But then, two boys who were like saints might have seen me talking to them and felt I was bullying them. Being kind, they bought two buckets of instant noodles for those two, and with a not-so-nice tone, asked me to make the noodles for them. At that moment, I was busy with other things and didn't have time to make the noodles, so I said, "Make them yourselves." Suddenly, these two got mad and shouted at me, "What kind of attitude is that? We think you have even less sense than we minors do." I was startled and at a loss for words; they ended up making the noodles themselves, littering the place to gross me out. I felt really hurt at the time, being bullied by the younger ones, and felt quite powerless.

Dr. Liu: Hello, it's really unfortunate that you've experienced such a troubling situation, being bullied by two minors. It's truly upsetting and unfair to be reprimanded despite being the one who was wronged. Smoking and spitting in public are indeed uncivilized behaviors, and being disabled doesn't exempt one from this. They shouldn't justify doing distasteful things by claiming to be the weaker party. Those young people who sided with them clearly couldn't distinguish right from wrong, thinking you were the one bullying them and trying to back them up. This indicates that these young people may not have fully developed their values yet and can't view matters dialectically. They only saw you criticizing them without considering that they were the ones acting uncivilly. You might consider putting up no-smoking signs in your supermarket, so they would think twice before lighting up. This way, others won't feel inclined to stand up for them when you address their behavior. Although you suffered some grievance, arguing with those young people likely wouldn't yield any results. Reasoning with unreasonable people is just a waste of breath. Take care~

Dr. Zhao is a professional counselor, and Xiao Ming is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Ming shared the following concern:

Client: How can he detach himself so quickly? Is it out of ruthlessness or rationality? We're in a long-distance relationship, so why does my boyfriend not reply to my messages from noon until the entire night? The next day, when I express my sadness and unhappiness, he just says he's helpless. (Is it because he's busy working overtime?) For the next two days, neither of us talked to each other, because this issue of not replying has happened many times before, it's always like this. In the evening, I posted on my social media about "letting go" and saw that he deleted the QQ status where he said he wanted to walk life's journey with me. I only hoped he could take the initiative to comfort me, but instead, he moved on even faster than I did. I then posted another update on social media, crying my heart out, sharing a photo of us that he loved most, and called it our last farewell. He still didn't reach out to me. Why, when I say I'm crying, doesn't he feel any heartache for me? He hasn't contacted me at all, can he really stay this composed? I don't have any specific demands, but even if we're separating, doesn't it deserve at least a brief message from him? Does he think that just because I say I want to let go, there's no longer any relation between us? Does what I do, whether happy or sad, no longer have anything to do with him? How can he detach so quickly? Is there truly no feeling left? Even ordinary friends, upon knowing someone is crying, would at least give a polite word of comfort, right? The last time, due to this, we were on the brink of breaking up and didn't speak for five days. In the end, it was me who reached out first, barely maintaining the relationship.

Dr. Zhao: Hello, OP! I really feel for what you're going through. It seems you're a girl with deep emotions, dedicated to your feelings, gentle, and kind-hearted. It appears your boyfriend may not value or invest in your relationship as much as you do, and he's slowly withdrawing. I'm not sure about your usual interaction patterns, but judging from the two moments you shared on social media and his reactions, it feels like he's using a "cold treatment" strategy to push you to initiate a breakup. As you mentioned, this issue isn't new; it often ends with you backing down, reaching out, and reluctantly keeping things going. There's a lyric in "Red Rose" — "the one who is favored feels justified to be fearless." Either he believes you won't leave him and uses this to control you, or he wants you to initiate the breakup to end the relationship. Whatever the case, this relationship is hard to sustain. "If I say I want to let go, does he think we have no relationship at all? Whatever I do, whether I'm happy or sad, does it have nothing to do with him? How can he detach so quickly? Does he have no feelings left? Even as a regular friend, upon hearing the other cry, wouldn't one politely comfort them?" Each question is like a dagger in your heart, visible and painful. Maybe he isn't cold-hearted, but rather, he doesn't want to keep this entangled and hopes to end it swiftly, yet he hopes you'll suggest the breakup, which might ease his guilt. I believe when everyone initially says "I love you," they are sincere and hope to grow old together. But life isn't always as we first envisioned, and we might not be lucky enough to meet the right person from the start. Perhaps, OP, you can muster the courage to sit down with your boyfriend, hear his true thoughts, and even if the outcome isn't what you wanted, it's better than being deceived and tormented in a relationship. Maybe everyone experiences the pain of a breakup, one of life's darkest times. I remember when I broke up with my first love, feeling like the world lost its color, devoid of meaning and hope. But it was this challenging time that gave me deeper insights into love, helped me grow, and led me to meet someone better. Perhaps others have hurt us before, but they've also helped us grow and find better happiness. I wish you, my dear, to find greater happiness one day. I'd also like to share how I worked through a breakup: 1. Accept the reality and have no further expectations of him. 2. Release your emotions: write emotional journals, talk to close friends, travel to relax, listen to favorite music, find a quiet spot to cry or scream, engage in aerobic exercise. 3. Reading and learning can bring peace and personal improvement. 4. Try developing some hobbies to divert attention. 5. Affirm yourself daily with positive feedback, building confidence and strength. 6. Consider his shortcomings and faults. 7. When feeling really down, watch some funny videos, which can bring lots of joy!

Dr. Zhang is a professional counselor, and Xiao Qiang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Qiang shared the following concern:

Client: I'm almost 60 years old, and I really dislike my mother's control. How can I break free? I'm nearly 60 now, and my mother still calls every day saying, "You need to take care of me, I'm already old." She's been saying this since I was 30, and my brother has always been taking care of her. Hearing this makes me less and less willing to go home, and my heart feels more and more distant.

Dr. Zhang: Hello! You're almost 60 years old, and your elderly mother is at least over 80. Logically speaking, this is the time to dutifully care for her. But you haven't mentioned why you're unwilling to take care of your mother; is it just because she calls every day asking for your care? We're not here to make moral judgments. Perhaps you have your own difficulties. Maybe you experienced poor treatment from her in your childhood, or you simply don't like her too much, finding her nagging as she gets older frustrating. However, there are many responsibilities in life that we can't avoid. Supporting our parents is a legal obligation for everyone, unless the parents have committed serious acts of abandonment, abuse, or harm and have lost their guardianship rights; otherwise, one cannot exempt themselves from this duty. So facing an aging mother, we need to show more tolerance and understanding for the hardships of raising children. Understanding the psychological traits of the elderly is important. For them, the greatest changes involve loss, such as losing their looks, health, social status, and earning capability. In short, the continuous experience for the elderly is one of loss. As they grow older, they may encounter numerous physical ailments, which can lead to diseases. Their sense of loneliness becomes more pronounced and can easily lead to mental health issues. Growing old is very pitiable, and everyone will face this day. It is a time when they especially need the care and companionship of their children. With understanding, perhaps the time spent with your mother in her final days can melt the frozen emotional knots in your heart, bringing you closer to her and achieving reconciliation. Best wishes! These are just some humble thoughts from Hong Yu, hoping they are helpful to you. If you find them useful, please click "useful" for me. Thank you for your question.

Dr. Sun is a professional counselor, and Xiao Yu is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Yu shared the following concern:

Client: I think psychological issues are the result of thinking too much and doing too little. People who think less and do more may end up physically exhausted, but after a good night's sleep, everything's fine. Those who think too much suffer from insomnia night after night, becoming more agitated the more they think. Can't we just balance thinking with doing?

Dr. Sun: Hello, I’m sending a big hug your way. After reading your description, I can see that you’ve been reflecting on psychological issues lately. As someone with similar thoughts, I can truly understand your feelings of confusion. Based on your description, "psychological issues are the result of thinking too much and doing too little," I have a similar example: In primitive societies, there were no psychological disorders; these issues gradually emerged after social rules were established. Personally, I think this example is quite similar to what you are saying. You mentioned your doubt: why can’t we think about as many things as we do? As society progresses, we are exposed to more and more information and our thinking becomes more diverse, making it hard to stop unrealistic thoughts. However, I really agree with your point about "thinking too much and doing too little." If we linger solely in the realm of fantasy, it’s easy to get trapped in it. We need to have more practical ideas, and if there’s something we want to achieve, it’s best to make efforts to pursue it.

Dr. Zhao is a professional counselor, and Xiao Lan is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Lan shared the following concern:

Client: The situation is likely to stay the same as age keeps increasing. What can be done about age getting older? I wish I could press a pause button on aging until I've finished this exam, until I've figured out who to choose, whether it's the person I met through matchmaking or a classmate. If age is increasing, I also have to handle them properly. Then the situation is likely to change and remain the same.

Dr. Zhao: Dear poster, how are you? After reading your description, I can feel your anxiety and the distress over your choices. Sending you a hug~~ From what you've described, your anxiety seems to be more than just about exams and choices. It feels like you have many unfinished matters that you're in a rush to complete now. From your wish for your age to remain the same, I invite you to reflect: have you set a strict timeline for your life? At what age you should have accomplished certain things? People are often afraid of unpredictability and uncertainty, so they hope everything happens according to plan, one thing after another, in pursuit of stability. However, everything in this world is impermanent, with only time moving steadily forward. Whether it's about exams or choosing a partner—especially choosing a partner—it's not something to be rushed. All choices will have an impact on us, deep or shallow. Ultimately, it is our choices that shape us. I hope you can embrace impermanence and uncertainty, and remain calm and confident through the flow of time. Wishing you happiness in life!

Dr. Liu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Hong is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Hong shared the following concern:

Client: At 26, I'm mentally struggling every day. Is there something wrong with me psychologically? I'm from the lower strata of society, a 26-year-old woman with issues stemming from my original family. I don't own a house or a car, but I have over a hundred thousand in savings. I graduated from a vocational college and worked for three years. Recently, I switched jobs and moved back to my hometown, which didn't go well. After being unemployed at home for two months, I'm now working at a local company in my hometown, doing a different job with a monthly salary of 7,000, which is 1,000-2,000 less than before. It's a state of "not dying but not truly living." I used to think about when I would earn over 10,000 a month and buy a house. Gradually, I watched those around me, and people in my social circle, living better and more exciting lives. I feel terrible, like I can't do anything, with low emotional intelligence and no value. I really want to rid myself of the feeling that my value is only realized when I'm needed or recognized by others, but I'm constantly struggling with it. I once had a glorious past, considered the hope of the family, but I've fallen. Among my relatives, I am the one doing the worst, and every day is torture. I don't know what I'm doing. I have no desire for life. I used to be ambitious, but now I'm just a failure. I want to escape this life but can't. My biggest wish is to go live in seclusion in the mountains, haha. In the past, I could adjust when things were bad, but now it's been going on for over a year and these negative emotions continue.

Dr. Liu: Hello: I can sense the pain and struggle in your words, here's a hug for you! Due to a job change, you've returned to your hometown, and with the change in environment and reduced income, you feel inferior and disheartened when comparing yourself to relatives and friends, leading to a sense of hopelessness and a desire to escape. I completely understand your situation and would like to try talking to you to see if it can bring some relief. 

1. Having a correct understanding of yourself. From your tone, it seems you view yourself negatively when you describe yourself as "part of the lower strata with issues in my original family, no house or car, and about a hundred thousand in savings." However, having a college degree, being young with an almost 10k monthly salary, and having savings doesn’t actually categorize you as being in the lower strata, does it? You're only 26; not having a house or car isn't a big issue. Focus on the advantageous resources you currently have and use them well. With effort, an education, work experience, and stable economic independence, houses and cars won't be an issue. Regarding the original family problems you mentioned, though you didn't specify, it sounds like it might involve low self-esteem. But the awareness you have about yourself is very valuable, and through self-adjustment, original family issues can be resolved. 

2. Understanding setbacks and changes. Life is a long journey with ups and downs. Sometimes you shine, sometimes you hit lows, but with persistence and effort, there's nothing to fear. Having had a job with nearly a ten thousand monthly salary demonstrates your capability. You've got it in you, and sometimes things are out of our control, like the unexpected work issue you talked about. For things we can't control, it's best not to worry and focus on what we can do. For instance, no matter what job you're in, strive to improve your work performance and abilities. As long as you're capable and recognized by your leaders, there is room for growth. Once you’re on the path to promotion, you'll move up from the lows, and life will change. Nobody's life is a straight line; changes will happen, so don't be discouraged by temporary setbacks. Just don't give up, and things will get better one day. 

3. Observing your tendency to compare. In this commercialized, restless society, many psychological imbalances are fueled by comparisons. Comparing yourself might provide some motivation but more often leads to psychological imbalance and distortion, especially pointless comparisons. You feel the worst among your relatives and friends, which is a result of such comparisons, making you feel inferior and hopeless. But everyone’s situation is different; there's no need to compare with others. Live your own life—only you know your best and worst. Others have their troubles, and you have your dissatisfactions. From another’s perspective, there are certainly aspects of your life they envy; you just don’t see them.

4. Sense of happiness. Happiness isn't solely tied to income. Just because someone earns more doesn’t make them happier. Wealth doesn’t guarantee a good life. The line between happiness and unhappiness can be thin, often just a matter of mindset. A person content with little and knowing when to stop is much happier than one who is insatiable—hence the saying, "Contentment brings happiness." If you find yourself complaining about low income, consider how many are unemployed and striving to land a job like yours. Without this mindset, even with a high income and possessions, you might still have complaints. Only by learning to be grateful, content, and altruistic can one truly experience happiness.

These are just some thoughts from Hong Yu, and I hope they'll be helpful to you. If you find them useful, please remember to click "useful" for me. Thank you for your question.

Dr. Zhang is a professional counselor, and Xiao Hong is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Hong shared the following concern:

Client: A sixteen-year-old girl: I'm so tired from interacting with my friend, should I find a new one? It's really exhausting being friends with her. She always gets upset and stops talking out of nowhere, and when I ask her what's wrong, she doesn't say anything. We've been playing together for a long time, and I feel like I don't want to hang out with her anymore, but I'm a bit reluctant to let go. However, she's always like this, and it seems like I'm the one who always has to cheer her up. I'm so tired.

Dr. Zhang: Hello, here’s a warm hug for you. While choosing who to be friends with and deciding whether to cut ties with someone is our personal freedom, it’s important not to casually decide to change friends. Doing so can make it more challenging to form new friendships, and if we later realize our previous friends weren't as bad as we thought—especially when pride is involved—we might miss out on a great friend and find many situations beyond repair. Everyone has different values, and whether it’s family, friendship, romance, or work relationships, interacting with others always requires adjustment. Our ways of thinking, styles, and opinions differ, naturally leading to conflicts and disagreements among people with different personalities. At such times, we should focus on resolving conflicts rather than escalating them.

You mentioned that this friend frequently gets angry and silent, and doesn’t explain when asked what’s wrong. Have you considered why this might be? Is this behavior typical for them, or does it only happen when they’re upset? Are they just temperamental, getting over things quickly, or are they a ticking time bomb, ready to explode at the slightest provocation? Such situations don’t necessarily mean you need to placate them. While comfort and concern between friends are important, it’s also crucial to provide necessary support and guidance when a friend faces difficulties or clear issues, rather than only offering comfort during their unhappy moments and then distancing ourselves. Allowing such negative behaviors to worsen without intervention is a mistake. Blaming it solely on the friend without timely prevention or intervention is also wrong.

You mentioned you’ve played together for a long time, and though you don’t want to continue, you’re reluctant to stop. This shows you care about this friend, and given that this relationship may have lasted years, a sudden departure would be hard to adjust to. Thus, it’s advisable to carefully consider your actions. Phil’s advice is to start with an honest conversation. Clearly express your dissatisfaction with this friend’s frequent anger and silence, or ask why they behave this way. See if you receive a satisfactory answer, and if not, decide based on their response how to proceed, whether by addressing the issue or something else. If they consistently refuse to change, you might consider distancing yourself a bit, but don’t abruptly cut ties. Given your long-standing connection, a sudden break might leave lingering ties or other consequences. Hence, if reducing contact is necessary, do it gradually. If this behavior is new, could it be due to some significant change? Or perhaps they expect a certain response from you that you haven’t noticed? I hope my response can help you (･ω･)ﾉ.

Dr. Zhao is a professional counselor, and Xiao Qiang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Qiang shared the following concern:

Client: Why do I always think about pleasing others? I'm actually very unwilling inside. Why do I always aim to please others? It's distressing. Deep down, I'm really unwilling, but because of certain situations, I have to.

Dr. Zhao: Hello, I see that you're feeling distressed and uncomfortable because you've done something you really didn't want to do. Sending you a big hug 🤗 Based on your description, I'd like to clarify something: when you say you try to please others, is it because you can't help but want to please them? Or is it due to some objective reasons that you want to please others? Is it one of these reasons, or both?

Firstly, if it's because you can't control your urge to please others, try to observe why you want to please them. In life, there are people who want to please others to gain recognition and praise, leading them to struggle to be themselves. In psychology, this is referred to as a "people-pleasing personality," characterized by always putting others' needs above their own and is often due to unprincipled kindness. People with this personality are extremely sensitive to others' feelings, tend to elevate others while devaluing themselves, hesitate to make requests, find it difficult to say no, and lack boundaries and principles. If this describes you, you might need to take a good look at yourself. Start by embracing that inner child who needs praise, approval, and love, and feel that sense of self lacking love. You can also practice self-love.

Secondly, understand your boundaries and principles. We can't make everyone like us, and our abilities are limited. Thirdly, when you find yourself engaging in people-pleasing behavior, don't blame yourself right away. Observe why you feel the need to please. What is the need behind this pleasing behavior? Can this need be fulfilled in other ways? When you love yourself enough, the need to please decreases. So, learn to love yourself.

Of course, in the workplace, some pleasing behaviors might exist to achieve certain goals—for instance, to secure a project, you might need to please the other party. Distinguish which situation you're in; once you understand the root cause, only then can we find a way to resolve it. That's it for my response. I hope you have the courage to be yourself and find happiness and joy.

Dr. Wang is a professional counselor, and Xiao Lan is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Lan shared the following concern:

Client: Constantly complaining, do people around me feel like I'm being forced to do things? Even if I'm doing something I might enjoy, I'll still symbolically complain a bit to make it seem like I'm being forced. It leaves me a bit unsure of what to do. For instance, when applying for a scholarship, I might say, "Ugh, why are there so many questions to fill out, it's so annoying," but when the time comes, I'll still complete it.

Dr. Wang: Hello, I read your question and felt your distress and sadness about your habitual complaining and how it affects others' perception of you. Let me first give you a warm hug. The main issue seems to be: [I keep complaining, even when doing something I might enjoy, I symbolically make a fuss, making people around me feel like I'm forced to do things. It leaves me a bit unsure of what to do.] It appears that the root of the problem lies in your habitual complaining behavior. Whether encountering good or bad situations, you tend to complain, which seems like a habitual action, but there's likely an underlying reason. Generally speaking, there are several main reasons for complaining: 1) A negative mindset leads to complaining. Someone who often finds themselves in a negative state of mind can easily develop a tendency to complain and may show dissatisfaction with people or things around them because of storing too much unhappiness or negativity internally. These emotions can "cultivate" a complaining mentality. 2) Complaining breeds more complaints. Emotions are contagious. Positive emotions generate more positive emotions, while negative ones lead to more negativity. Complaining will similarly lead to more complaints. 3) Dissatisfaction with people or things leads to complaining. As the old saying goes: "It's not the lack of goods but the lack of equity that troubles one's mind." It means that having less isn't frightening; what's frightening is inequitable distribution, especially unfair distribution, which can lead to complaints. If we have expectations and demands from some people or things and these aren't met, it can create a mindset prone to complaining. Based on the analysis above, let's explore some methods to solve the problem, hoping to be helpful. ~Firstly, you need to find out the underlying reason for your habitual complaining. Only by identifying the root cause can you implement targeted solutions. ~Secondly, self-awareness is crucial. Try consciously controlling your complaining behavior, speaking more positively, and stopping yourself immediately when you are about to or have started complaining. You can also seek help from friends to remind you, helping you become more aware of your behavior—awareness is the beginning of change. You've already recognized your problem and are seeking change, which is a great start. ~Lastly, action is more important. Change is difficult for anyone; it requires time and persistence. So being aware of the issue and consistently detecting it over time becomes even more essential, because if everything stays at the level of thought, it's impossible to change the status quo—only by taking action can you truly transform. I hope my answer has been helpful, and I wish you the best.

Dr. Zhang is a professional counselor, and Xiao Ming is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Ming shared the following concern:

Client: My son is 14 years old and is experiencing adolescent fetishism. He refuses to communicate. How can I help my child? My son started collecting women's underwear when he was 13, usually his mother's. We've talked to him about overcoming this, and bought books related to boys going through puberty. Recently, we've noticed that he's been buying women's underwear, stockings, and masturbatory products online. He's also interested in watching Japanese anime and likes Hatsune Miku figurines, etc. I want to talk to him, but he refuses. How can I help my child?

Dr. Zhang: Hello, I'm sending you a comforting hug! From your detailed description: your son is 14 years old, and at 13, you discovered he collects women's underwear, mostly his mother's. Recently, you've found out he's buying women's underwear, stockings, and masturbation items online. He likes watching Japanese anime and is fond of Hatsune figurines. You've talked to him about overcoming these behaviors and bought books on puberty for boys. You now want to discuss this with him, but he refuses. Your concern is how to help your child. I truly empathize with your anxiety and worry over your son's fetishism. Firstly, fetishism is one of the sexual preference disorders, typically beginning in adolescence. It usually arises from suppressed sexual development, causing the individual to shift sexual focus to objects, using them as sexual stimuli for gratification. The person might be introverted, timid, easily anxious, and fearful of interacting with the opposite sex. Secondly, it's important to understand the underlying reasons for your child's fetishism. Whether it's due to a lack of scientific education during puberty, negative influence from media and the internet, or witnessing intimate behavior of parents during childhood. Thirdly, you've mentioned talking to your son about overcoming these behaviors and purchasing puberty-related books, which can serve as preventive early education. At this stage, it's advisable to intervene with professional counseling to prevent further development. I hope this helps you!

Dr. Zhou is a professional counselor, and Xiao Yu is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Yu shared the following concern:

Client: Why do I always feel like I'm the one being bullied? Am I easy to bully? I live in an old neighborhood, and everyone takes turns collecting the water fees. But every time it's my turn, problems arise. Everyone knows there's a leak in someone's home, yet no one admits it. No one wants to share the extra water cost, but I've already paid all the water fees upfront. Not a single person has reimbursed me. Have I given them the impression that I'm easy to take advantage of?

Dr. Zhou: Hello! I understand your feelings of helplessness and grievance. However, there are two points in your issue that you need to sort out and think about: 1. Why does there always seem to be a problem when it's your turn to collect the water fees? By 'problem,' do you mean a leak? Why does the leakage occur every time it’s your turn? What's really happening here? Is it a coincidence? 2. You are responsible for collecting the water fees, but you're not obliged to cover all the costs upfront. Why do you feel you need to pay everything in advance? Once you figure out these two questions, consider why you always feel like you're being bullied. Is it just in this situation, or does it happen often? Is it a recent feeling, or has it been present since you were young? In this particular matter, everyone takes turns collecting the water fees. If others encounter the same situation, I'm sure some would not pay in advance, as they're not obligated to. The best approach would be to first identify which household is responsible for the leak and then proceed with repairs. Before things are clarified, advancing payments without consent and then expecting others to share the cost is evidently inappropriate. You have voluntarily assumed the risk of not recovering the money, unless you're prepared to bear this loss if someone refuses to pay. Dealing with a large group can naturally induce psychological pressure, as groups tend to conform and can sometimes exploit the vulnerable. In dealing with this situation, you need to be more thorough in your considerations rather than making unilateral decisions and feeling wronged afterward. When someone is strong enough, they won't consistently feel bullied by others. These are just some humble thoughts from Hongyu; I hope they can be helpful to you. If you find this useful, just remember to tap 'useful' for me. Thank you for your question.

Dr. Wu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Na is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Na shared the following concern:

Client: I haven't even done my own job well, and now I have to take on my colleagues' work? I've just entered society and joined a private company; there are many things I don't quite understand. In our office of four people, besides having to clean the boss's office, I'm also given some responsibilities of the other two colleagues. I don't know how to refuse, and I haven't completed my own duties yet. What should I do?

Dr. Wu: Hello, I'm sending you a "relaxing" hug! I truly understand your worries and frustrations about not knowing how to set boundaries at work. Here's your basic situation: You're just entering society, working for a private company, and lacking experience in handling work and social interactions. Besides cleaning the boss's office, you also have to take on some miscellaneous tasks from two other colleagues, and you're troubled by not knowing how to refuse.

Analysis and Suggestions:
1. As you're new to the workforce, it's important to adopt a mindset of learning. Avoid falling victim to workplace manipulation and try to steer clear of mistakes caused by inexperience, as some errors can cause even more distress. You'll gradually come to understand this.
2. Prioritize completing your own tasks first. It's not only about maintaining quality and efficiency but also fulfilling your responsibilities. Helping colleagues with their tasks should be done at appropriate times. If cleaning the boss's office is part of your supportive duties, those two colleagues might assume you can handle similar tasks for them as well. It's crucial to have your own standards and sense of boundaries.
3. Entering society, you'll find that many things aren't as straightforward as they were in school. Learn to handle situations wisely. In the workplace, there's both division of labor and cooperation. Address any unreasonable tasks imposed on you at the right time, and do so without emotion.

I wish you success at work! The world and I care about you!

Dr. Chen is a professional counselor, and Xiao Qiang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Qiang shared the following concern:

Client: Severe depression, this time feels different from before, more serious, you know? I used to just have severe depression and moderate anxiety, but now, I'm pregnant, eight months along. However, this is definitely not prenatal depression. I'm 19, almost 20. My family is currently facing financial difficulties, and I'm moderately depressed, overly sensitive, and feel like I have a bit of social anxiety. Most importantly, I have a fear of doctors. It might be because during my prenatal check-ups at a certain hospital, the doctors there left some psychological trauma. How should I put it? It's just this inexplicable fear. The last two times, I was told that my relatives knew the director, so I went. But in the end, the relationship wasn't strong at all, and the doctor's attitude towards me was completely dismissive, not the same as with other patients. They just gloss over things with me, not taking responsibility. I've seen other patients getting different treatment, and it's like a 180-degree difference. Maybe it's because I'm too young, and they don't take me seriously. Once, I was exhausted from the whole day, and on top of that, my husband argued with me because he was too tired. Our home seems harmonious on the surface, but it's just avoiding quarrels. Every time we argue, it escalates to physical fights, leaving me furious. Why does it have to be like this? My life feels so bleak. Recently, I've been experiencing frequent insomnia. Even when I'm tired, I don't want to sleep, unless I'm totally exhausted, and I'm also waking up earlier than before.

Dr. Chen: Hello, dear poster, here's a hug for you~ After reading your description, it seems that your depression has been worsening recently, and you also have to face challenges in real life. I completely understand how exhausted you must feel both physically and mentally. According to your description, you are dealing with severe depression, moderate anxiety, and social phobia, all of which have accumulated and led to your current poor psychological state. Moreover, you are nearing your due date, and if your mental state continues to deteriorate, it could seriously affect your overall health. You mentioned feeling resistant to the doctor you've seen before. Perhaps you could try seeing a different doctor, one who doesn't have any vested interest in your family, which might help alleviate the sense of disappointment. It might also be that your expectations were too high with the previous doctor, making you more sensitive to the outcome.

Dr. Chen is a professional counselor, and Xiao Yu is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Yu shared the following concern:

Client: I have obsessive-compulsive disorder and always feel like I can't do anything right. How can I manage my emotions? I'm 23 years old and moved to Beijing for work after graduating. I've been working as a flight attendant for over two years. Since I can remember, I've lived amidst my parents' arguments every day, and each time they argued, I'd feel extremely anxious. In life, I have a bit of OCD; everything at home must be neatly arranged, and I live alone. I'm not sure when it started, but I've always cared a lot about what others think of me. At work, if even a small thing doesn't go as I expected, I tend to blame myself and feel like I haven't done anything right. These events play over and over in my mind like a movie. When talking to colleagues and supervisors, I'm very cautious and tend to overthink. Sometimes, after work, I find myself uncontrollably crying when I recall certain things, feeling depressed and very distressed. I frequently suffer from insomnia at night. There was a time when I even felt very oppressed during company meetings. Is there any way I can adjust my emotions? How can I stop myself from dwelling on these things?

Dr. Chen: Hello! Seeing your words feels like meeting you in person. Hearing your story, I can sense your loneliness, grievance, and helplessness, as you silently bear your emotions alone. As someone living in Beijing, your inner strength might not allow you to show vulnerability, and this state is deeply relatable. 

[Reconcile with the child within through present strength] The "little me" within you vividly remembers the trauma and emotional tension caused by your parents' arguments. I imagine every child striving to survive in such an environment finds it incredibly difficult—needing to be obedient and careful with every action, fearing that any inadequacy on their part might lead to conflicts elsewhere. Over time, these feelings can lead to self-criticism and a lower sense of self-worth. As an adult, you may subconsciously transfer this pattern into interactions with others, showing tendencies toward compulsion, inner inferiority, and feelings of regret and self-blame. This happens because your "inner child" hasn’t been allowed to grow; the insecurity still seeks external validation. The way to improve this state is to draw strength from the present. You are no longer the "little me" of the past; you've already done your best amidst past challenges. You are now an independent adult with control over your life. You have the capability and wisdom to face any interpersonal issues that arise and the belief that there are more solutions than problems. By nurturing this belief and reconciling your current self with your past "little me," you have the opportunity to overcome your current difficulties.

[Seek help from professional psychological counseling] 
1. Practice improving your sensitivity to your body and mind. Children from environments of parental tension tend to have heightened emotional sensitivity compared to those from more stable homes. Though this seems a disadvantage, it can also be your strength. Learn to adjust your neural sensitivity through mindfulness meditation, letting go of the automatic pattern of overthinking; cultivate empathy and the ability to understand others' feelings, which can effectively relieve interpersonal stress and help manage insomnia. 
2. Reconcile with your parents from your original family. As a 23-year-old living independently, you have physically separated from your parents. However, it’s also essential to psychologically loosen your ties with them. Recognize that everything from the past might hold significant meaning for your life. No path is walked in vain; every step counts. Establishing healthy boundaries of love with your parents allows your inner child to gradually mature. 
3. Consciously cultivate psychological resilience. You mentioned wanting to stop thinking about negative things, but realistically, it's difficult to achieve this directly. Ignoring a problem doesn't mean it's gone. Psychologically, there's a view that "the problem isn't the problem, how you deal with it is the problem." Change happens when you begin to face problems directly. If life’s waves are unavoidable, may you learn to surf them. Everyone has an inner resilience, known as psychological resilience, which helps restore balance after overcoming challenges. 

I hope my response provides some insight and help, wishing you a swift return to self-confidence and positivity. Keep it up!

Dr. Wang is a professional counselor, and Xiao Fang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Fang shared the following concern:

Client: The man's personality is like a child's, carefree about everything. Can he ever grow up? He's in his 40s, yet still has a childlike personality, loves to play, and is indifferent about everything, just waiting for things to be handed to him. Can he really grow up? Will he be like this forever?

Dr. Wang: An individual's self has three states: the parent self, the adult self, and the child self. A person with a well-developed personality can skillfully navigate all three states, adapting them freely according to the needs of different roles and situations, which makes them charming and versatile in their roles. In contrast, a person with an underdeveloped personality often struggles to switch appropriately between these self-states based on role or situational needs. As a result, they might appear either capricious, overly rational, or rigid, with a singular role that finds it difficult to adapt to changing circumstances (acting like a child everywhere). To change: First, they must recognize the negative impact that a singular role has on their life and those around them. Only when they realize the need to adjust and change will there be a possibility for transformation; otherwise, change is indeed difficult.

Dr. Zhao is a professional counselor, and Xiao Mei is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Mei shared the following concern:

Client: Why do I feel fear and resistance toward work? As soon as I think about going to work the next day, I feel negative emotions. I fear work and don't feel safe in the environment. Whenever I think about going to work the next day, I feel despair and unhappiness with life. Please help me build the right motivation.

Dr. Zhao: Hello, poster! Even with just a few words, I can sense a lot of helplessness and fear. Although I don’t know the reasons, your fear of work, the lack of hope, and unhappiness really touch me. Your expectation of wanting “the right motivation” suggests that you are inherently positive, ambitious, and hold certain standards for the meaning of life. Given the limited information, we can have a simple conversation. Here are a few questions that might help you!

1. What is the background behind obtaining your current job? How did you get this opportunity? Why did you want this job? What does this job fulfill for you?
2. What is the underlying meaning behind your fear of work? After feeling the fear, how do you feel? Are there any methods to eliminate this fear? After eliminating the fear, how do you evaluate this job?
3. What factors in your current environment make you feel insecure?
4. What is the relationship between the environment and the job?
5. What is the relationship between this job and the meaning of life?
6. What is your ideal meaning of life?

I suspect you may have encountered some situation or person that is affecting your current perception of life, possibly related directly to the job or the environment. Some things have already happened, and what we can do is accept them. As for the uncomfortable feelings they bring, we can heal them through other methods; truly addressing the issue is key to finding a solution.

A perfect life meaning surely is hopeful and can provide us with energy to pursue it. From your questions, it seems you care deeply about the meaning of life, linking it with happiness and requiring motivation. However, life being meaningful doesn't necessarily equate to happiness. In your current view, happiness seems more like an emotion that may be related to your work or current situation. As for motivation, internal and external motivations complement each other. External motivation is indispensable, but internal motivation is crucial.

Life isn’t so perfect, nor are any lives free from imperfections. Joys and sorrows cannot solely dictate the tone of life. Live attentively, with less entanglement, and there are no obstacles we can't overcome. Good luck! May everything go as you wish soon! The sky is blue, you exist, life can be beautiful! The world and I love you!

Client: My girlfriend and I didn't have a fight, but there are times when she doesn't want to talk or meet with me. We didn't argue, everything was fine, and nothing happened. She just suddenly doesn't want to talk to or see me for a while, and I don't know why. Can someone help me?

Dr. Zhou: You and your girlfriend haven't had an argument, everything was fine and nothing happened, but suddenly she just doesn't want to talk to you or see you for a while. You're confused and don't understand why. Why would she suddenly not want to talk to you or see you? You must be feeling very upset at this time. You can't figure it out, how did it come to this when everything was fine? There are a few possibilities for this situation: 1. You might have unintentionally done something that upset her, and she's sulking. You could try to communicate with her to see what's going on. 2. Maybe you didn't meet some expectation she had. Girls often like unexpected surprises, especially when they're in a relationship. 3. Everyone goes through periods of low emotions, and it might naturally get better in a few days. I don't know how long you two have been together, but getting along with someone requires gradually understanding them. As you get to know her better, you'll become more attuned to her thoughts. Take care.

Dr. Li is a professional counselor, and Xiao Qiang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Qiang shared the following concern:

Client: At 36, stalled by workplace PUA tactics and entangled with a playboy, feeling exhausted and empty? A 36-year-old woman has nothing and even feels like dying. Although she's reached mid-to-high-level management, the past few years have been marked by intense competition. She faced PUA tactics from a disgusting and disturbed female boss who spread rumors, slandered her, and ruined her interpersonal relationships, leading to an insecure position and mental and physical exhaustion. Emotionally, she got involved with a commitment-phobic playboy, but fortunately managed to extricate herself after a year, though she inevitably feels empty. She's considering going abroad for further studies to change her situation but feels powerless because she lacks support and constantly senses judgmental looks from peers. Am I just a person buried by society's trials and tribulations?

Dr. Li: Hello! In today's societal environment, I fully understand your worries and anxiety, because generally speaking, society has stricter expectations for women, especially for those who are older and unmarried, who have to bear a lot of pressure. From your description, due to consecutive setbacks in the workplace and in relationships, you've started to doubt your self-worth, even concluding that you're worthless. However, if you could take a step back from your current situation and view yourself as an observer, I believe you would see that this 36-year-old woman actually possesses many strengths. A woman who can reach a mid-to-high position in a company through her own abilities indicates that your knowledge and skills are more than sufficient. You've also been in a relationship; although the other person was a playboy, it still shows that you are inherently attractive. I think even a playboy wouldn't randomly choose an unattractive woman to date, right? So, you're not worthless at all; on the contrary, you have many outstanding qualities and belong to the exceptional group within the larger population. It's just that we tend to blame ourselves for meeting the wrong people, like encountering workplace manipulation or a non-committal playboy, leading to self-doubt and a lack of confidence. In reality, this rationale is illogical; meeting scoundrels doesn't equate to it being your problem. Moreover, one of your impressive qualities is your ability to wisely withdraw when you realized your partner was non-committal. You know, many people remain trapped in such relationships without realizing it, or even if they do, they lack the ability to leave. So, your rationality and decisiveness are indeed excellent qualities. And fortunately, whether it's workplace manipulation or unfruitful relationships, you've already moved past them. You're not stuck, you've managed to cut your losses in time. Looking on the bright side, those painful experiences are behind you, and it's time to start a new chapter. I believe that the reason you went through those two experiences is not coincidental; they are reminders for you to see your deeper needs. For example, during workplace manipulation, what weaknesses did you have that were exploited? In your relationship with the playboy, what were you longing for or needing? It might be these unmet deeper desires and inner deficiencies that attracted you to such relationships, and these experiences serve as reminders to recognize them, preventing future pitfalls. From a conventional perspective, an unmarried woman at 36 is seen as "leftover," but biologically speaking, a 36-year-old woman is at the height of her maturity. Gone are the naivety and ignorance of youth; a 36-year-old woman is more composed and enriched. At 36, you still appear young and beautiful externally, possessing beauty, capability, and experience; there's nothing better than now. Also, without family obligations, you can boldly pursue what you want without too many considerations. A woman's life isn't only about marriage and children, although if you prefer that, there's nothing wrong with it. Every lifestyle deserves respect. You might want to ask yourself more about what you truly desire. Once you figure it out, go for it. If it’s challenging to sort things out on your own, I suggest seeking professional psychological counseling to better find resources and move toward the future. Blessings to you! I specialize in using cards, dolls, and small objects for precise individual presentations and transformations, sharing psychological knowledge with you. You're welcome to follow and direct message me if you have questions!

Dr. Liu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Hong is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Hong shared the following concern:

Client: My child is five years old and watches TV continuously after coming home from school. How can I talk to him so he would listen? After telling him and he doesn't listen, I feel like yelling at him, or scaring him with threats of hitting, but I've never actually hit him. I always feel that hitting only addresses the symptoms, not the root cause, and yelling isn't beneficial for him either. I want to foster his confidence and self-discipline, but sometimes I feel powerless.

Dr. Liu: Oh, dear parent, your child is only 5 years old. I sense that you're very anxious, almost expecting them to act like an adult. You hope your child can follow your wishes, be extremely well-behaved, self-disciplined, and refrain from watching TV. But 5-year-olds take time; parents need to accompany their growth. You still need to play with him. If parents can't spend time with their children, then TV becomes the only option. Without someone to keep them company, children will end up playing with machines or toys. As someone with experience, my usual approach, which you might consider, is to find playmates for the child. This could either be adults playing with them, or if you don't have the time, find peers their age in the neighborhood, from next-door neighbors, relatives, or friends. This helps nurture the child's social development, laying the foundation for better social integration and learning how to interact with others in the future. Parents should cherish this time; you realistically have about 10 years to effectively be there for your child.

Dr. Wang is a professional counselor, and Xiao Lan is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Lan shared the following concern:

Client: Why can't I help comparing myself to those closest to me? I have a sister, and we attend the same university and are even in the same class. However, I can't stop comparing myself to her. Sometimes, I become particularly sensitive when others call out her name because I feel she receives more attention, is more popular, and more liked. I wonder if it's because at home, family members always called her name while overlooking mine, which made me especially sensitive to this issue. In class, teachers prefer to call on her and pay more attention to her. I try my best to get the teachers to notice me and call my name, but sometimes it gets a bit tiring. I don't know what's wrong with me or why I'm so sensitive about this name-calling issue.

Dr. Wang: Hello, OP~ Here's a warm hug for you. I completely understand how you feel. From your description, I've gathered that we're quite sensitive about the issue of calling names. However, this is actually a very normal and common phenomenon. It's rooted in the subconscious belief that the other person is more excellent than we are and is more likely to gain others' approval. But this perception is not entirely correct. First of all, let's acknowledge that this kind of mindset is normal. Everyone might feel a bit jealous of those they're close to. This is what Freud referred to as the death instinct, an innate self-protection mechanism we are born with. So, there's no need to deny it. Perhaps the other person may indeed be more excellent in certain ways, but not in every way, right? Surely, you have your outstanding traits. Everyone is like that; each person has strengths and weaknesses, and no one is perfect. Gaining attention from teachers, classmates, and friends doesn't represent everything. Moreover, they cannot accompany us throughout our lives. The one who accompanies us the longest is ourselves, so the most important thing is self-acceptance, while others' opinions are irrelevant. Of course, I also suggest seeking help from the school's psychological counselor to adjust these emotions. Best wishes~.

Dr. Zhang is a professional counselor, and Xiao Yu is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Yu shared the following concern:

Client: I've been trying to stop myself from cursing the deities—am I suffering from religious OCD? How do I solve this religious OCD? I can't control the urge to curse the deities; my family is quite devoted to Buddhism and burns incense daily. Once, a fleeting thought crossed my mind to curse the deities, and since then, I haven't been able to stop. I try hard to restrain myself. Every day, when I open my eyes, I feel like I'm fighting against it but continuously suppress myself. Now, I can go a whole day without cursing, but the psychological pain persists as I resist myself. When I see a cross, I think of Jesus and feel the urge to curse too. I consulted a psychologist, and she said the thinking of deities is different from ours; they won't punish. Just curse if you want to, but I can't do it. I'm afraid if I follow my compulsions, it will get worse. I can't get over this hurdle in my heart and keep cursing. Every moment, I think about this issue and control myself. I've been dealing with this since August—half a year now. I've been controlling myself every day. I read books on Morita therapy, "accept nature, do what you should," but whenever I'm doing something, I'm reminded of this issue and try to control it. Do you think I'll live with this pain forever, constantly controlling myself every day? I feel tortured to death... It's been half a year, and I can't move past this. I don't want to die.

Dr. Zhang: Behind obsessive-compulsive symptoms, there might be a strong unmet need. I guess in a family that is quite religious, expressing anger and aggression directly might not be welcomed. It seems that deities hold the beautiful expectations of your family, while also bearing your dissatisfaction and aggression. You've been trying to suppress your aggressiveness, but where there is suppression, there is resistance. That energy has always been there; unable to be released, it torments you internally. Your family is very religious, and it seems that you're not as devoted, yet inevitably you align with some of your family’s views, such as not offending deities. Cursing deities feels like going against your deeply religious family, disrespecting sacred beings and your elders, which makes you feel guilty. Be it deities or Jesus, they're all spiritual anchors. Deities are your family's faith, while you're seeking your own life's meaning and belief, seemingly choosing a path different from your family's. Maybe in life, you disapprove of the actions of certain authoritative figures, perhaps even feeling angry, but out of respect for elders or authority, you can't express your discontent or anger, or the authority might be so overbearing that expression isn't allowed, causing inner conflict. As young people age and gain experience, their self-awareness strengthens, allowing for personal judgment and analysis. Sometimes, it's essential to break convention, challenge authority, and establish your standing. As the saying goes, the new wave overrides the old, continuing while innovating for greater strength in each generation. Perhaps consider, if deities meant to save all beings or Jesus preaching love for others heard your cursing and understood your message, how might they respond to you?

Client: A 15-year-old girl, I recently broke up and can't control my behavior and emotions. The breakup has been particularly hard, and my parents don't know, so I can only cry secretly by myself. We have a dog at home. When I'm feeling really down, and it keeps moving around, I just want to hold it. But I find it so annoying that I feel like I want to kill it. I don't really think that in my head, but I've already started hitting it, and my hand hurts. Suddenly, it occurs to me why I can't control myself, so I just hug my dog and cry. But next time it happens like that, I still can't control my behavior.

Dr. Zhao: Hello, I'm here for you with a big hug～ From your description, you've recently encountered something that makes you feel very sad, and maybe you're not quite sure how to vent. I truly sympathize with your situation. Based on what you've described, since your recent breakup, you're feeling quite upset and find it hard to control your behavior when you're crying intensely. I suggest trying a different way to vent your emotions when you're feeling down. If you harm those living and conscious beings, it will only make you feel heavier inside. Venting is definitely necessary, and you can choose more appropriate methods, such as going to an amusement park or gym to relax, get your body moving, and sweat to boost your metabolism, which might help you relax both physically and mentally.

One day, Friend Wang approached Dr. Zhao expressing concern about Xiao Fang's wellbeing. Friend Wang mentioned that they want to help Xiao Fang but need more information to provide appropriate support. Friend Wang asked Dr. Zhao about Xiao Fang's situation.
What should Dr. Zhao say?

Dr. Sun is a professional counselor, and Xiao Na is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Na shared the following concern:

Client: Not all childbirth is out of love. Are there any books suitable for the older generation of parents? The previous generation of parents had children 80% of the time as an investment for returns, not really understanding love and responsibility, which has led many of us young people to grow up in emotionally undernourished families. Even after reaching adulthood, it's difficult to escape, and escaping doesn't truly solve the problem. I'm seeking help from everyone—are there any books suitable for older generation parents? Books that help them realize the essence of the parent-child relationship and enhance their understanding of themselves and love. Even though we know it's difficult to change our parents, we should still make efforts, hoping more people can benefit!

Dr. Sun: Hello, original poster, sending you a hug~ After reading your description, you hope to find ways to change some of your parents’ ingrained thinking. Perhaps your childhood in your family of origin brought you harm, and I really sympathize with your situation. Based on what you've described, “not all parenthood is out of love”—indeed, I understand what you're trying to express. It’s similar to the easily contested saying, “There are no parents who don’t love their children.” There are exceptions to everything. You mentioned wanting to collect books recommended for the older generation to read, but I personally think that most elderly people are not physically suited (vision, for instance) to reading unless they have maintained a long-term habit, so this is a hardware issue that cannot be ignored. More importantly, the way older people think comes from the accumulation of experiences from their era, and trying to change that after decades is very difficult unless they choose to do so willingly; otherwise, it’s really hard to change ingrained thinking. Lastly, you mentioned the harm you experienced in your family of origin. I suggest that you should start by changing your own mindset; perhaps younger individuals are more open to accepting new ideas and changing old ones.

Dr. Xu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Jun is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Jun shared the following concern:

Client: My mom uses isolation to punish me, everyone likes to bully me, despair, wanting to die? My mom uses isolation to punish me because I’m disobedient. She encourages others to ignore me. Over time, when no one talks to me, she comes around to talk to me, buys me hair ties, clothes, and such. She always complains in front of me, saying this is bad, that's bad, how someone treats her poorly. I hate them, they always side with my mom. Yet she gets along well with them. Everyone dislikes and isolates me. My mom never acknowledges me. What is my mom doing?... I always felt the problem was with me, constantly reflecting and trying to improve myself. I always want their approval; I feel there is something wrong with my behavior, that I'm not good enough, not strong enough. I love my mom very much. Yet she thinks I don’t love her. I'm always unhappy, always feeling lonely. Everyone mocks me for being withdrawn, having no friends, they all like to bully me. I feel no love. Despair, wanting to die.

Dr. Xu: Hello, I see your anxiety, feeling of helplessness, powerlessness, frustration, and loss. Your mother's unstable emotions and double standards invisibly control you, and you attempt to please her by strictly adhering to her standards for a good child, attacking, denying, and doubting yourself inwardly. You may feel not good enough, strong enough, or excellent enough to please those around your mother, seeking not to isolate yourself. Loving and depending on your mother is natural for a child, who perceives her as strong, authoritative, and energetic, while feeling small and weak.

Accept your emotions; when you feel depressed, allow yourself to experience these feelings for a moment, then understand yourself, accept your imperfections—imperfections define perfection. Discover your strengths, add value to yourself, and learn to love yourself. Only by loving yourself well can you love others. Give yourself affirmation, embrace, praise, and recognition, cultivating a healthy relationship with yourself. Strengthening your inner resilience makes seeking inwardly easier and more realistic than external pursuit, enabling you to change yourself and influence others, though you can't change others.

Your mother's dissatisfaction is simply her dissatisfaction; her emotions are hers, not yours. Feel the discomfort her accusations and isolation bring, then understand her, rather than being controlled by repetitive cycles. Declare your independence without being affected, recognizing yourself as a unique individual with strengths and weaknesses. Some people will dislike you, while others will like you. Evaluate yourself neutrally, refrain from overthinking, replace catastrophic thoughts with positive ones, decisively make decisions and promptly act.

Your mother, though an adult, also has shortcomings and things she can't do perfectly. No one is flawless. Loving your mother doesn't mean seeing her as a perfect saint. Children are often kind enough to love their mothers unconditionally, though mothers may sometimes struggle to love their erring children unconditionally. Nevertheless, overall, they love their children.

Accept the present situation or take responsibility to change it—these are tasks we've always engaged in. Focus on your current tasks without regretting the past or worrying about the future. Don't concern yourself excessively with others' opinions, courageously be yourself. Though imperfect, bravely and positively face falls, failures, and successes without fear; this is life. Pursue a sense of achievement, experience, worth, self-esteem, and existence. Best wishes—both the world and I love you.

Dr. Sun is a professional counselor, and Xiao Lan is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Lan shared the following concern:

Client: Should I continue pursuing a girl I like even if she likes someone else? I just started high school this year and met a girl I really like. However, we are not in the same class or even in the same building, and we almost never talk in person; we only chat on QQ. But recently, her friend told me that she likes someone else, and also mentioned that she's not very keen on replying to my messages. I don't know how she feels about me, and I'm feeling quite confused about whether I should continue pursuing her. I'm also not very good at pursuing girls or chatting with them. Could the teachers give me some advice?

Dr. Sun: #Every flutter and fondness is a process of bravely facing your inner self# Do you like her? Why? Give your feelings some justification; maybe it's a mirror that helps you recognize yourself. From your description, it's apparent you have an affection for the girl, but have you ever considered which qualities and actions of hers make you feel this way? You’re in high school, different classes, different buildings, only chatting—these limitations and coincidences are what make youthful emotions so beautiful, yet also bring a sense of innocence and blindness. Perhaps some small actions of hers moved you, and that's why you like her, want to approach her, and hope to take the relationship a step further. This is an emotional need. Is this feeling truly the love of wanting to live and strive together, or is it just friendship to get through high school together? Liking someone is simple, but understanding what you like about them and what attracts you can help you discover the qualities and charm you need to develop in yourself. For instance, if you like gentle and outstanding girls, maybe you're attracted to these qualities because you desire yet lack them yourself. Don’t rely on others to tell you the truth; trust your feelings and charm, and let the other person know your intentions while understanding their thoughts. My suggestion to you is that if you feel confused or unsure, you can subtly express this to her; sincerity has always been the best method of communication in relationships. Guessing too much and dragging things out will make you feel even more uncomfortable and tortured. If you truly like her, you can candidly tell her. If she isn't aware of your feelings, your inner emotions and grievances, and the actions that follow will make the relationship awkward. Do you have the courage to express your feelings? Conveying your intentions is not difficult. The cause, process, feelings, and what you hope for—clearly admitting your affection is also a way of facing yourself, admitting that liking someone is nothing shameful. Those who dare to express their feelings are very charming. Don’t conclude rashly; you need to make an effort to know the outcome, whether in love or in exams, both require “practice.” I wonder, what do you mean by pursuit? What have you done in pursuit of her? Is she aware of these efforts? Does she know you are pursuing her and not just interacting as friends? For anything or anyone you like, you must strive for it yourself. As you grow older, you may realize nobody will love and tolerate you for no reason, and nothing will always be yours. Everyone and everything is changing, and we grow and strive to pursue what we want. So, if you don’t want to lose her, don’t want to see her with someone else, or are unwilling to just be friends, you need to work hard to pursue her. Understand her feelings, care for and look after her body and life, grow with her—little things can express liking and affection, and if you are attentive, you will certainly notice them. Liking is a beautiful feeling but also encompasses disappointment and pain. Don't forget that, besides romance, you have friendship, family love, teacher-student bonds, etc. Love is important; at any age, you can fall in love, and learning is the same. Recognize the diversity of your roles; don’t let one emotion hold you back. You are not only the boy who likes her; you are also a student to teachers, a child to parents, a friend to brothers, a young soul. There are many things to do and change, and love doesn’t come just once. Thus, if you dare to pursue, pursue; if you succeed, great, if not, conscientiously go about your business. Future changes might be more than you can imagine.

Dr. Li is a professional counselor, and Xiao Na is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Na shared the following concern:

Client: I'm gay, and the other person doesn't have the courage to continue with me. Does that mean they don't love me? Is it correct to say that if someone doesn't have the courage to continue with me, it means they don't love me?

Dr. Li: Hello, there! Nice to meet you here on this Q&A platform. First, in response to your statement, let me share my own inner answer: the other person doesn't have the courage to continue with you, not because they don't love you, but because they don't love you enough. They might be more concerned about others' opinions, or perhaps they have more options compared to you and therefore chose to give up. But we shouldn't doubt ourselves just because the other person gave up. Homosexuality is normal, but unfortunately, it is not widely accepted in our country yet. I want to give you a hug here~ Those who believe in love will find it. Today may bring doubt and denial, but tomorrow we can look forward to unwavering choices; it may come late, but it won't be absent. I hope my answer can give you some confidence.

Dr. Chen is a professional counselor, and Xiao Lan is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Lan shared the following concern:

Client: I spent a year preparing for the graduate entrance exam, but ended up registering for a lower-tier university. Should I try again or continue studying? I spent a year getting ready for the exam, initially aiming to review well for Dalian University of Technology, and if not, then Hefei University of Technology. But before the exam, Dalian University of Technology changed its specialized courses, which made me panic, so I registered for Hefei University of Technology. Now I feel like I settled for less, and suddenly lost the motivation to study. I'm thinking about retaking the exam, but every day feels incredibly painful, and I don't know what to do.

Dr. Chen: Hello. We always have different goals and plans. Some goals are set quite high, making them difficult to achieve, but setting them too low leaves us unsatisfied. Lowering your expectations is not as brave as choosing what you truly want. The process of preparing for graduate school is long, and you are continuously working hard for your choice. You might encounter difficulties, which is completely normal. During these times, your goals and dreams guide you, and the university you aim to attend is waiting for you. Now, concerning the school you are applying to, you feel you have the capability to attend Dalian University of Technology, and you deserve something better. Life is relentless, and so is the struggle. During this special stage in life, give yourself a satisfactory answer. If you choose to retake the exam, you need to be mentally prepared, plan for the worst, strive for the best, and leave the rest to time. Alternatively, you can list the pros and cons of retaking the exam. Do you have the confidence to overcome difficulties and work hard to achieve your goal? Among many potential outcomes, there are often no clear signs, but I believe that the results will not disappoint after your efforts. Whatever path you choose in life, whether it's this or that, embrace it with peace. Every path has a reason for its journey; just keep moving forward. Many people pursue their dreams, and remember, Barrymore once said: "A man is not old until regrets take the place of dreams." Perhaps this is why many people refuse to be ordinary and bravely surpass themselves. I hope my response helps you, and I wish you all the best. Good night.

Dr. Zhao is a professional counselor, and Xiao Mei is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Mei shared the following concern:

Client: I'm constantly surrounded by feelings of sadness, and I can't integrate into the crowd. What should I do? I ate too much dinner again, to the point of deep disgust. I just wanted to gain a little weight so I wouldn't be so frail, but my eyes haven't rested much, and I haven't exercised or walked. My problems have worsened. What should I do? I feel like everyone doesn't like me anymore, probably can't like me. Anyone who interacts with me can feel the extreme awkwardness. I'm still very afraid at the company, and I want to cry. My voice is getting quieter and quieter, and my face must be lifeless and dull. The sadness in my eyes must be terrifying—I see it in the mirror, but I can't change it. I can't find joy. I'm scared to talk to others, especially those aggressive, foolish yet confident people who seem like bad guys. My throat is sore from inflammation, and even my neck is stiff. This is the excuse I use. I hide in a corner, afraid to speak, not even daring to answer a delivery phone call. I had an unpleasant encounter with a colleague—I think that's what happened.

Dr. Zhao: Is it you, sister? Hello there. After hearing your story, I realized I used to be in the same situation as you. People often couldn't hear me speak, hahaha, and my mood got progressively heavier, feeling invaded by a little depression (´･ω･`). Back then, I slowly broke through it little by little. I even had a kind-hearted teacher take me to chase away ghosts, which actually worked wonders. But we're not discussing ghosts here. At that time, I responded to my depression positively, like having a conversation: Depression: "If you don't drink water for three days, you'll die." Me: "Yeah, but I've already tried it and it didn't work, right? Your turn is over, hahaha." Depression: "Um... you're right, but there are so many problems, dying would be easier." Me: "A painless death, euthanasia costs at least 6 million. Wouldn't it be a waste to spend 6 million on suicide, hahaha?" Depression: "Oops, that makes so much sense... I'm about to be convinced." Well, something like that. I used to spend most of my time talking to myself this way to verify my thoughts and intentions. Once I understood my thoughts, I would address them, possibly by accepting the emotions or confronting them. Everyone has their own solutions. Although I choose to accept things, that might not work for you (´･ω･`). You can try it out, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask me (sending kiss). Oh, you mentioned having issues with colleagues. Although I haven't entered the workforce, I have some ideas. You might invite them out for a small meal costing around 10-15, and during the meal, ask about their thoughts and share yours. Self-disclosure means sharing your feelings with them, but I suggest you just mention how the conflict affects you emotionally. Not everyone around you in the workplace is trustworthy, so it's good to be cautious. There's actually a book that's perfect for you called "Atomic Habits." It's about cultivating good habits happily, and it's super inspiring.

Dr. Liu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Qiang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Qiang shared the following concern:

Client: Some wounds are hidden away; do they need to be exposed again? There are past events that you can't recall unless you try hard to remember them, but sometimes you still feel their impact. Should you bring them back to mind, or should you just let them stay buried deep in your memory?

Dr. Liu: Hello, you mentioned that some past events are hard to recall without careful reflection, but sometimes you still feel their impact. Many experiences indeed don't stay in our minds easily, but our bodies remember them. These experiences are timeless and don't disappear over time. I'm not sure what specific kind of "impact" you're referring to. If it's something brief and with minimal effect (like feeling a bit down or crying for a few minutes), recalling or burying them can both be great options. However, if the impact is more significant, like feeling sad for an entire hour and reminiscing about it every six months, I would suggest recalling and experiencing it, feeling that pain. Recalling isn't about "thinking about the details," but about experiencing the emotions and physical sensations you had at that time. Allow these feelings to exist without judging them. You can also let your stronger present self comfort your past self, giving them warmth and strength. If the impact is so significant that it affects normal life, I hope you seek more professional help to move past these painful memories or find a better way to coexist with them. Whether you choose to bring these painful memories to the surface or keep them buried deep inside, I hope you can love yourself gently.

Dr. Zhou is a professional counselor, and Xiao Hong is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Hong shared the following concern:

Client: Group photo, feeling uneasy at the edge of the central position? Today, the unit took a group photo, and I was at the edge of the central position, with my hand awkwardly supporting a leader who often criticizes me. Seeing the photo, I felt an indescribable discomfort in my heart. Looking at myself in the photo, there's a sense of nausea and dislike. The person in the photo looks anything but confident, even a bit ingratiating. Psychology often says to love yourself, but why can't I manage to love myself?

Dr. Zhou: Hello, poster, here's a hug for you～ From your description, it's clear that a position in a photo has been bothering you a lot, and I can see how it has put you in a bad mood. I really sympathize with what you're going through. Based on your account, your appearance in a group photo has led to feelings of self-loathing. Perhaps one way to stop dwelling on this photo is to distance yourself from it; I suggest putting it somewhere in your home where it’s not easily noticeable. Although I don't know much about your real-life behavior, I still think this self-loathing is unnecessary. Many of us actually aren't aware of our true personalities, and not knowing ourselves can lead to misunderstandings and even self-loathing. Perhaps you can reflect on your performance at work. If you had to do something you didn’t want to because of the environment, that’s normal. In such situations, we don’t have a choice, and we automatically make decisions that are most beneficial for ourselves, decisions that are survival-oriented.

Dr. Zhao is a professional counselor, and Xiao Jun is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Jun shared the following concern:

Client: I've been under a lot of stress lately, going to bed late and getting up early, not getting enough sleep. How can I reduce stress? Recently, I've been staying up late and getting up early, not getting enough sleep each day, with too many tasks to complete. My body is also giving warnings, as I've caught a cold twice in a row. How can I become like those resilient people who are self-disciplined and full of energy?

Dr. Zhao: Hello to the person asking the question. You're experiencing a lot of stress, with a busy schedule that keeps you up late and up early every day, and your body is signaling a warning. Here's a hug for you. You aspire to be a strong and disciplined person, full of energy. We've seen reports, particularly about some successful people, who manage to rest only a few hours a day yet remain energetic throughout. So how can we, as ordinary people, achieve this? Let me share a few tips with you.

1. Prioritize Important Matters. You mentioned you have many tasks each day, but which ones are truly important? Make sure to do the truly important things first, completing them before anything else. Less important tasks can be postponed or delegated. Don’t try to handle everything yourself as it can be exhausting and drain a lot of energy.

2. Cultivate Focus. It's recommended that during any given time, you focus on one task. Frequently switching between tasks wastes a lot of time and energy. A good method to enhance focus is using a Pomodoro timer: work for 25 minutes, rest for 5 minutes. During those 5 minutes, you can drink water, use the restroom, or do some simple relaxation exercises, but avoid thinking about your task to let your brain fully relax and prepare for the next 25 minutes.

3. Exercise. Physical activity is a great way to recover and maintain energy. If you're usually busy with work, you can use your commute time. For instance, get off the bus a couple of stops early and walk home, or walk to a certain floor instead of taking the elevator directly. Using fragmented time this way helps relax the mind, keeps the body active, and improves energy levels.

I hope my suggestions can be of some help to you. The world and I care for you.

Dr. Li is a professional counselor, and Xiao Mei is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Mei shared the following concern:

Client: Feeling psychologically repressed and self-deprecating, I think I'm selfish and wonder why I can't express myself? In middle school, I was among the top in my grade, a seemingly average boy in my class transferred to a better school and came back with grades similar to mine. I felt mentally pained and distressed. A student transferred from Shanghai to our school and scored better than me, which was very difficult for me psychologically. I realized I couldn't stand losing and always struggled to treat such people well. Yet, under pressure, I would always put on a good attitude in front of them, though inside, I felt deeply uncomfortable. Is this kind of mentality normal for me? This problem persisted into high school and even through to university, where I attended good schools. At every stage, encountering someone better than me brought psychological repression and discomfort. Although I smiled and got along with them, I couldn't help but feel uneasy, unable to express why.

Dr. Li: Hello, I see that when you face someone who is more capable than you, you feel uncomfortable inside, while also feeling pressured to suppress it. First, I want to tell you that this feeling is completely normal and has nothing to do with selfishness; most people experience this. From your story, I sensed feelings of unfairness, a sense of disparity, and envy. I'm not sure if these are your feelings as well. Peers in the same class may have caught up to you academically because they received better educational resources. Classmates who originally had more resources joined your class and took the ranks that originally belonged to you. As humans, we naturally feel the pressure from competition, and that's okay. I see that you, pressured by circumstances, maintain a good attitude toward competitors and suppress your own feelings, which is also perfectly normal. As social beings, humans care about others' opinions and want to maintain their image within a group. In today's society, the feeling of discomfort you experience isn't readily accepted and may be criticized with terms like "petty" or "selfish," which you mentioned as a self-assessment. In this pressure, it's understandable to try to protect yourself by not showing your dislike for others. Knowing that your feelings deserve gentle treatment might make you feel a bit better. From here, you can choose whether to express these feelings or not. Expressing them, if you have the courage to face any additional pressure, is an excellent choice to live more freely. If you're not ready to express them yet, that's okay too. You can try to convert this sense of competition and discomfort into motivation. The other person might be a competitor but can also be a role model. If you can change their role in your mind, perhaps you can learn from them and improve yourself! I hope you can embrace every part of yourself and find ways to make yourself even better.

Dr. Sun is a professional counselor, and Xiao Jun is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Jun shared the following concern:

Client: The hardest part of learning is establishing the connection between the known and the unknown. How should learners approach learning? The hardest part of learning is establishing the connection between the known and the unknown, linking what needs to be learned with what has been learned. However, in reality, this is often challenging. What are the reasons for this?

Dr. Sun: Hello, I found your concerns very familiar because I faced the same issue. During my university years, I often wondered what exactly I could do with what I was learning and how it related to the knowledge from previous semesters. I studied a major in computer communications and spent the first year learning a lot of math. I couldn't understand why I had to learn it. Little did I know that later on, this mathematical knowledge would become important tools that I frequently used. I was also frustrated when learning programming, wondering why there was so much theoretical knowledge taught instead of directly teaching us how to apply it. At the time, I was very anxious because I thought I wanted to learn how to create software, but it seemed like the school wasn’t teaching us anything about that. It was only later during internships and work that I realized that those lessons were truly foundational - having a foundation allows you to better construct a program. My experience is not to rush things; let time help us establish connections between the knowledge we've learned and what we need to learn. The reason it feels difficult to establish these connections now might be because some pieces of the knowledge puzzle are still missing, making it difficult to complete the middle structure of the puzzle. If you've learned a lot yet still don't understand the connections between them, you can use mind maps to help sort things out. I hope this sharing offers some help.

Dr. Wu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Jun is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Jun shared the following concern:

Client: Actually, it's probably the avoidance being tortured psychologically, feeling very tired and unmotivated? It's likely just being tortured by my own avoidance. At the beginning of September, on the third day of entering the experimental class, I had a breakdown once, cried for two hours, was told by others that I was too fragile and lazy, and then I cried for nearly two hours. Since then, I haven't really shared my true feelings in detail with friends; I might think it's a bit pretentious. I did tell them that because of depression, I felt like committing suicide (of course, I didn't act on it). After the midterms, I fell into a state of depression for about half a month, feeling that life was really hard, constantly wanting to sleep forever, thinking it would be better to die. I really wanted to sleep, felt so exhausted, anxiety hitting when I thought about what the next class was; feeling anxious and collapsing when I realized I only had a few minutes left to sleep, that time was truly exhausting. Every day of going to school and doing homework felt like torture, I just wanted a good night's sleep. Now the intense depression isn't that strong anymore. I'm maintaining an avoidance stance toward the teachers, feeling like I've disappointed them, lacking motivation myself, and being really afraid to interact with them, thinking they don't like me. The same goes for classmates; I feel like I'm really bad, and maybe they don't like me either. It's just really tiring.

Dr. Wu: Hello, I’m sending you a virtual hug. From what you've described, you’ve been unable to relieve your study stress lately, and it seems like you're on the brink of breaking down. I genuinely sympathize with your situation. Based on your description, after entering the honors class, you noticeably feel more pressured and find your emotions easily overwhelmed. If you feel that this anxiety and depression are seriously affecting your normal academic life, I recommend seeking help from the school's counseling center. You also mentioned feeling very dissatisfied with your performance and believe others think the same way about you. This is a very common thought, as we often approach issues with a self-centered perspective. If you're willing to communicate more with those around you about your thoughts, you might gain a more well-rounded view instead of such an extreme one.

Dr. Wu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Qiang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Qiang shared the following concern:

Client: Whenever someone starts chatting with me, I end up spilling my secrets. How can I change this? I feel like whenever an old friend, whom I originally intended to distance myself from, reaches out to chat, I can't help but reveal some of my secret thoughts. Even though I don't want to keep in contact or share much about myself or gossip about my friends, I can't resist it every time... How can I change this? I almost blurted out my most shocking secret, and only later realized that I had laid out my secrets on a silver platter while the other person didn't reveal anything about themselves.

Dr. Wu: Hello to the person seeking advice, —————————————————— sending you a hug, sympathetic to your situation. You feel like a "fool," easily pouring out your heart to others with just a few words from them, and doing so quite willingly, like you'd help count the money if someone sold you out. Reflecting on it afterwards leaves you feeling awful, thinking you're not "smart" or "good" enough, leading to regret. Yet you can't resist talking the next time, causing frequent confusion—do you lack "self-control"? —————————————————— From your description, there might be a few situations: being younger in the family, receiving more attention, but having less of a voice. It might be difficult to express your thoughts or even finish speaking at home. Why do you want to distance yourself from your childhood friend? If revealing secrets is a subconscious desire to maintain closeness, then this wish to distance might not be your own, but rather "coerced." Although this coercion makes you superficially want to distance yourself, your subconscious thinks the relationship should continue, thus secrets are inadvertently revealed. —————————————————— My suggestion is to figure out the reason: whether the desire to distance is genuine or forced. Improve the relationship with family, and express your need for communication and expression. —————————————————— That's all. Wishing you a pleasant mood, and keep going~.

Dr. Li is a professional counselor, and Xiao Qiang is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Qiang shared the following concern:

Client: My wife was... I saw it happen. How should I face her now? I don't know how to deal with her, I constantly feel uncomfortable, and I'm at a loss for what to do.

Dr. Li: Hello~ Greetings to you, dear questioner. I'm glad to connect with you here on this Q&A platform. Speaking practically, the essence of a marriage is indeed a partnership—a collaboration between two people to achieve mutual gains. However, the value exchange in a marriage inherently includes the provision of emotional value. You mentioned your wife being... Could you elaborate on the specific situation? Was it voluntary or involuntary? Why did you see it as well? If you saw it, was it intentional for you to see, or did you see it accidentally?

Next is dealing with his issues. In a work scenario, if your partner makes a minor mistake, would you immediately resign? Maybe work and personal life are different, but the same principles apply. You've chosen a lifelong partner, and now this has happened, regardless of the reason. I can imagine how impactful this is for you. Firstly, let's channel our emotions appropriately, and once we're calmer, aim to soothe each other's feelings. After both parties' emotions have stabilized, we can engage in effective communication. Here, we need to openly share our thoughts and propose feasible plans, agreeing together and then executing them. Life’s long path will inevitably have its bumps. Life might not be as perfect as we imagine, but we should still nurture our love for it. Let's give each other a chance and move forward firmly hand in hand, shall we? I hope my answer provides you with some help, and sincerely wish both of you overcome these current challenges together.

Dr. Xu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Ming is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Ming shared the following concern:

Client: What are common methods for shifting from external interventions to internal interventions in treating depression? I'm not a doctor and have no medical background, so everything I discuss here is based on my own practical reflections. The two most common methods for treating depression are: 1. Medication 2. Therapy. However, these methods are both external interventions. When external interventions are not possible, such as being unable to afford medication or access therapy, combating the illness relies on internal interventions. From the perspective of emotional illness, internal intervention means the patient "treating" themselves. There are many similar expressions, such as: unwillingness to give up, a strong will to survive, turning grief and anger into strength, etc. The "goal of treatment" is to convert the negative energy of depression into positive energy. Regarding whether internal intervention is effective for severe depression, my personal view is to give it a try, as if treating a dying horse as if it's alive, but this statement is directed solely at the patient themselves. Who wouldn't prefer medication and medical attention if available, rather than "carrying the burden alone"? Not to mention there are details that cannot be fully explained. As for the "transformation" mentioned in the topic, I refer to converting the negative energy directed at oneself from the outside world into positive energy within, to combat the illness.

Dr. Xu: Hello! Although my knowledge is limited, I’m still very happy to discuss this issue with you. Based on the literature and resources I have come across, depression has the possibility of "self-healing," which is what you refer to as "internal intervention" that might be effective, but this is only applicable to mild depression. Research statistics show that one-third of mild depression cases can heal on their own, one-third may progress to moderate or severe depression, and the remaining one-third will remain unchanged. For moderate to severe depression, it's best to adhere to medication treatment, supplemented by psychological therapy, and this is a very long and painful process. From your description, I understand that what you refer to as "internal intervention" probably means "an intrinsic positive vitality." However, the result of depression is precisely the deprivation of this vitality. It’s not that your lack of intrinsic vitality leads to depression, but rather the result of depression that leaves you lacking in intrinsic vitality, and this is uncontrollable. Therefore, the role of medication treatment is to alter your hormone levels to restore this vitality, making psychological therapy effective. This is why moderate and severe depression requires persistent medication treatment first, followed by psychological therapy. Last night before going to bed, I read your question and kept thinking, trying to find an appropriate metaphor. Suppose depression is compared to a fierce beast locked in a cage. Our hormone levels are like this cage, and due to genetic influences, the sturdiness of the cage varies; some cages even have gaps. The stimuli from the environment are like someone outside the cage constantly provoking the beast; under the combined effect, the beast is very likely to break out. The function of medication treatment is to reinforce this cage directly, and the role of psychological therapy is to increase the beast’s tolerance to these provocations. What you call internal intervention is akin to wishing this beast would always remain calm, but the very existence of this beast is to challenge this belief, just as the existence of depression deprives a person of their internal intervention power. I hope my response helps you.

Dr. Wu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Jun is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Jun shared the following concern:

Client: I want to do something but lack the courage to do it because I'm afraid of failing. How can I overcome this mindset?

Dr. Wu: Hello, from your question I can see that you already have your own thoughts. If there's something you're thinking about doing, then go ahead and do it. It's normal to have concerns, which indicates that you have high expectations for success. Learn to accept yourself: admit that your abilities are limited and that you might not do well; acknowledge that you might fail and fear failure; recognize that you might lack the courage to face failure. Acceptance does not mean giving up. If you take action, there’s a chance of failure, but if you don’t act, there’s no chance of success. Compared to failure, never trying is the biggest regret. You can try breaking down your goals into smaller, daily actionable steps. Achieving a little every day will build your confidence and bring you closer to success. The world and I are fond of you ~_^.

Dr. Wu is a professional counselor, and Xiao Jun is their client. During a counseling session, Xiao Jun shared the following concern:

Client: Feeling guilty about everything because of others, what should I do? Other people's emotions sometimes affect me. When they're unhappy, I sometimes think it's my fault and can't help but worry about them. But this makes me anxious and uneasy. Am I depressed?

Dr. Wu: Because you haven't truly understood yourself yet—your personality, your relationships—and you haven't established your own style of behavior and way of handling things. Additionally, you might have underestimated yourself, feeling that you're not important enough, thus you need to form your own independent personality. Don't rely too much on others. In other words, don't let others excessively influence your way of doing things. Avoid casually labeling yourself. If you feel inclined towards this kind of thinking, you might consider consulting a professional. I think when a person doesn't understand themselves, it's like being a dandelion swaying in the wind, drifting wherever the wind takes them, without direction, completely random. Once someone has their own direction, they don't focus too much on others, but rather on what they want and the path they wish to follow. You can explore the reasons behind this, and see if there are any events that immediately connect to this thought. Take some time to reflect.
